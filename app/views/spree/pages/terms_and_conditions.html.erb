                     <h2>Processing</h2>
                     <p>Orders placed after 2:00pm Pacific Time will be processed the next business day. Natures Flavors makes every effort to process and ship orders as soon as possible, excluding weekends and holidays. Occasionally, orders may be delayed due to inventory shortages or increased order volume. Please keep in mind the additional transit time for your product to arrive once we ship it when estimating your order's arrival date. We use UPS for most domestic shipping. International shipments, and orders being delivered to P.O. Boxes are shipped USPS.</p>
                     <p>For all commercial accounts we require a 10 business days processing time. This includes all orders $200 and more. Please plan you order ahead. The reason for a longer wait time on commercial accounts is due to the fact that the order processing for business accounts is a much more detailed process. All orders made fresh to order. Expedited service is available on request.</p>
