                     <h2>Processing Time & Shipping</h2>
                     <p>Orders placed after 2:00pm Pacific Time will be processed the next business day. Natures Flavors makes every effort to process and ship orders as soon as possible, excluding weekends and holidays. Occasionally, orders may be delayed due to inventory shortages or increased order volume. Please note that our processing time is typically lengthier because each product is made to order, meaning you get the freshest product possible. When estimating your order's arrival date, please be sure to include the additional transit time it will take for your product to arrive once we ship it. We use FedEx for most domestic shipping. International shipments, and orders being delivered to P.O. Boxes are shipped USPS. We reiterate that for all commercial accounts we do require a 10 business days processing time. This includes all orders $200 and above. Please plan orders accordingly. The reason commercial accounts experience a longer processing time is because the order processes for business accounts requires a much more detailed set of procedures. Remember, all orders are made fresh to order.</p>
