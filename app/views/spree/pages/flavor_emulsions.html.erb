                     <h2>WHAT IS A FLAVOR EMULSION?</h2>
                     <p>Flavoring emulsions are made through high-shear processes where we minimize the droplets of the oils within our flavor oil and emulsifier mix, usually gum acacia. Through this process, we made the oils into highly concentrated, water-soluble flavors that are great for high-heat applications.</p>

                     <h2>STARTING USAGE FOR BAKING EMULSIONS:</h2>
                     <p>Flavor emulsions are water-soluble and highly concentrated flavors. For that reason, starting usage is 0.1% - 0.5%. by weight. Experimentation with flavor emulsions is needed. Feel free to call us for some tips when trying flavor emulsions for the first time in any of your culinary creations. When substituting flavor emulsions for flavoring extracts, use one teaspoon of baking emulsion for every one teaspoon of flavor extract. If the flavor of the added flavor emulsion to your baked good or beverage tastes good and dissipates after three to five seconds, it's perfect!</p>

                        <p>Flavoring emulsions are a great choice to use to flavor any foods that don’t require baking. Since flavor emulsions do not have alcohol, they are great for flavoring frostings, puddings, custards, and more. Our flavored emulsions are excellent for home bakers, chefs, manufacturers, and small businesses.</p>

                     <h2>WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EXTRACTS & FLAVOR EMULSIONS?</h2>
                     <p>Flavoring emulsions are water-based flavor agents, whereas extracts are alcohol-based flavoring agents. When using flavor emulsions for high-heat applications, you don’t have to worry about the flavor “baking out” as water-soluble ingredients don’t evaporate as quickly as the alcohol in the <%= link_to "flavor extracts", (Spree::Taxon.find_by_name("Flavor Extracts").present? ? seo_url(Spree::Taxon.find_by_name("Flavor Extracts")): '/')  %>. The result of the end product is a more potent flavor in your baked goods when using bakery emulsions. Flavoring your treats with Nature’s Flavors baking emulsions allows you to taste test the creation and have a good idea if it needs more flavor emulsions added as well as how it will taste when it’s done.</p>

                     <h2>WHAT IS IN A FLAVORING EMULSION?</h2>
                     <p>A flavor emulsion is a flavor that is suspended in a base of water and vegetable gum. Flavoring emulsions have a thick consistency and mix well into baking applications. The water base also doesn’t add any additional flavor to the flavoring emulsion, so you have a natural flavor in your baked goods. At Nature’s Flavors, our flavor emulsions are made from the finest natural and organic ingredients.</p>

                  <h2>OVER FLAVORING YOUR PRODUCT WITH FLAVORING EMULSIONS</h2>
                  <p>You have over-flavored your product with flavor emulsions if you notice a minty or medicinal taste. If you are burping up the flavor over an hour after eating the delicious food, you most likely over-flavored it. Always start by using the minimum amount of flavoring emulsions, and taste the food as you go, adding a small amount if desired. The key is not to overdo it with the flavor emulsions and create a finished product that tastes great and leaves people wanting more.</p>
