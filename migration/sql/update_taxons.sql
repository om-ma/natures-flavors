UPDATE spree_taxons SET description='Low-Glycemic or low-carbohydrate diets are dietary programs generally utilized to restrict carbohydrate consumption for weight control or for the treatment of obesity. Foods high in digestible carbohydrates such as bread or pasta, are limited or replaced with foods containing a higher percentage of proteins and fats (e.g. meat, poultry, fish, shellfish, eggs, cheese, nuts, seeds and peanuts) and other foods low in carbohydrates, including most salad vegetables, although other vegetables and fruits &ndash; particularly berries &ndash; are often allowed. The amount of carbohydrates permitted in a low-carb diet can vary. A recent nationwide study on low-carb dieters by Opinion Dynamics Corporation concluded that 78% of people who try low-carb diets lose weight. The median amount of weight loss on low-carb diets is approximately 16 pounds. Additionally, the study noted most keep the weight off. Many people experience a state of ketosis when starting a low-carb diet. It involves a loss of fat and occurs because, in the absence of sugar, the body will break down fat to use as fuel. Ketosis usually happens 3-4 days into the diet and dieters generally experience varying degrees of tiredness or fatigue. Ketosis can be easily monitored with the use of ketosis sticks, or kits, available at most pharmacies. Advocates of low-carbohydrate diets argue we are closer to the ancestral diet of our ancestors before the invention of agriculture, and therefore genetically adapted to diets low in carbohydrates. The invention of agriculture brought about a rise in carbohydrate levels in human diets. The industrial age saw a particularly steep rise in refined carbohydrate levels in western societies. Along with increased carbohydrate consumption came an interest in dietary science. In 1797, Dr. John Rollo reported on the results of treating two diabetic army officers with a low-carbohydrate diet and medications. A very low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diet was the standard treatment for diabetes throughout the 19th century. In 1863, William Banting, an obese English undertaker, published &ldquo;Letter on Corpulence Addressed to the Public,&rdquo; a widely read and well received book in which he described a diet for weight control giving up bread, butter, milk, sugar, beer and potatoes. In 1888, James Salisbury introduced the Salisbury steak as part of his high-meat diet, which limited vegetables, fruit, starches, and fats to one-third of the diet. In 1967, Dr. Irwin Stillman published &ldquo;The Doctor&rsquo;s Quick Weight Loss Diet.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Stillman Diet&rdquo; is a high-protein, low-carbohydrate and low-fat diet, and is regarded as one of the first low-carb diets to become popular in the U.S. And, of course by now, everyone has heard of the Atkins Diet, which advocates a low-carb diet he used in successfully treating patients during the 1960&rsquo;s. Sugar is an edible carbohydrate, mainly sucrose, lactose and fructose. Sucrose is a pure carbohydrate and important to the structure of many foods, including biscuits, cookies, cakes, pies, candy, ice cream and sorbets. It is also a common ingredient in many processed &lsquo;junk foods&rsquo;. When consuming food with high percentages of sucrose, beneficial nutrients can be displaced from the diet, contributing to an increased risk for chronic disease. It has been established that sucrose-containing drinks may be linked to the development of obesity and insulin resistance. As the American Medical Association points out, a diet high in fat and protein may be more filling than one containing a lot of carbohydrates. Nature''s Flavors offers low-carbers a low-carb paradise with sweeteners to spritzers to pancake syrups and even ice cream toppings. We have been manufacturing naturally flavored, low-carb and diabetic friendly products for over 25 years, with no artificial ingredients.

Our organic flavor extracts are pure water-soluble flavors, meaning, like our organic flavor concentrates, they will readily dissolve into water-based applications. We do not recommend adding organic liquid extracts to an oil base, as separation may occur. For oil-based applications, we recommend our oil-soluble organic flavor oils and our <a href="https://www.naturesflavors.com/287-flavoring-for-chocolate">flavor oils for chocolate</a>.<br /><br /><br/>What about organic extracts in high heat applications? It is important to note that flavors and colors will become less potent when exposed to high heat applications. Nature''s Flavors organic flavor concentrates are more heat stable than our organic flavoring extracts. We also offer <a href="https://www.naturesflavors.com/84-natural-flavor-emulsions-heat-stable">natural flavor emulsions</a> for high heat applications!<br/><br /><br /><br/>Should I use an organic flavor extract or a concentrate? Nature''s Flavors organic flavoring extracts and organic flavor concentrates are both certified organic, all-natural, and water-soluble. Flavor concentrates, however, have a cloudy and opaque look to them, while the organic flavor extracts are clear. This is not because the concentrates are any less pure, but concentrates are set in a gum acacia base, while organic flavoring extracts are set in an alcohol base.<br/><br /><br /><br/>When you are making a product that is clear, organic flavor extracts will be the better choice. Flavor concentrates are more heat stable than organic extracts, so concentrates are often the better choice for baking. Organic flavoring extracts are in an alcohol base and will affect the freezing point of any application that you put them into, while concentrates will not.<br/><br /><br /><br/>Organic Flavor Extract Usage: Start at under 0.5% of your total volume and slowly work up to 4% maximum. You will need to experiment with the amount of organic extracts and flavorings you use to achieve the perfect strength for flavoring your recipe. If you notice a medicinal or minty taste with organic extracts for baking, you may have over-flavored your recipe. Try reducing the amount of organic flavor extract you are adding.

These essential oil fragrances are concentrated liquids derived from plant sources that contain beautiful aroma compounds. An oil is essential because it carries a distinctive scent or essence, of the plant it is extracted from. Although they are generally extracted by distillation, other processes may be utilized including expression or solvent extraction. These natural fragrances and essential oils can be used in perfumes, cosmetics, soaps, and household cleaning products, as well as for flavoring foods and drinks and adding scents to incense, candles, and other products.<br/><br /><br /><br/>We have created natural fragrances and essential oils in the following scents, cedarwood, key lime, vanilla, cucumber and green tea, sandalwood, magnolia, lychee, baby&rsquo;s breath, purple rose petal, and passion flower - to name a few.<br/><br /><br /><br/>Our essential oils and fragrances are available in oil-soluble, water-soluble, and alcohol soluble forms.

UPDATE spree_taxons SET description='Nature''s Flavors Stevia Products are a great, natural way to add sweetness to your favorite dishes, beverages and baked goods! Stevia is derived from a shrub called Stevia rebaudiana that originates in Paraguay and has been used as a sweetener there for centuries by the Guarani Indians. It was first researched by a Spanish botanist named Petrus Jacobus Stevus, for whom it was named. Later, in 1931, French chemists isolated and identified the glycosides which give the plant its sweet taste: stevioside and rebaudioside. These glycosides were found to be anywhere from 40 - 300 times sweeter than sucrose, able to withstand very high temperatures, and non-fermentable. Stevia is widely used in Japan as a sweetener and is also popular in other countries, such as Brazil, Mexico and Russia. <br /><br />Our Stevia Products are a great alternative to ordinary sugar because they contain less than five calories per one ounce serving, but still achieve the sweetness you''re looking for. The glycosides present in stevia which give it its natural sweetness cannot be metabolized by the human body, which leads to the low calorie content of Nature&rsquo;s Flavours Stevia Products. So, if you''re looking to cut calories without sacrificing taste or sweetness, our stevia sweetened products are a great choice. <br /><br />Another benefit is the fact stevia does not raise blood sugar levels in humans and may, in fact, lower them. Consequently, they are beneficial for people with diabetes or those on carbohydrate-controlled diets. Also, studies have shown that replacing sugar with stevia in meals may lower blood glucose levels and aid in the control of type 2 diabetes.

UPDATE spree_taxons SET description='Xylitol is a natural occurring sweetener found in the fibers of many fruits and vegetables, and can be extracted from various berries, oats and mushrooms. It was discovered by German and French chemists in the late 19th century and popularized in Europe as a safe sweetener that would not impact insulin levels in diabetics. In addition to being primarily used around the world for natural sweetening purposes, xylitol&rsquo;s applications also include oral hygiene products, such as toothpaste, fluoride tablets and mouthwashes. The dental significance of xylitol was researched in Finland in the early 1970&rsquo;s, and shown by scientists from Turku University to have significant dental benefits. Xylitol was proven to be a &lsquo;tooth-friendly&rsquo; sugar alcohol, which does not contribute to tooth decay. <br /><br />Xylitol has proven effective in fighting bacteria, which is a significant contributor to tooth decay. It is able to do this because tooth destroying bacteria (Streptococcus mutans) cannot utilize xylitol to grow. As stated by the California Dental Association, &ldquo;Over time with xylitol use, the quality of the bacteria in the mouth changes and fewer and fewer decay-causing bacteria survive on tooth surfaces. Less plaque forms and the level of acids attacking the tooth surface is lowered.&rdquo; Research from Finland in the 1970&rsquo;s revealed that a study group chewing sucrose (sugared) gum had 2.92 decayed, missing or filled teeth compared to 1.04 in the group chewing xylitol gums. Recent research confirms xylitol&rsquo;s ability to reduce plaque and destroy harmful microorganisms, which can damage teeth. In several studies sponsored by the World Health Organization, participants using xylitol products including gums, toothpaste, and candies developed fewer cavities than those receiving placebo or no treatment. <br /><br />In addition, xylitol is kid friendly! Double-blind studies with almost 4,000 people, mostly children, found that xylitol can prevent cavities. The trials used xylitol-sweetened gum, candles, or toothpaste, with gum providing the best evidence. One study suggested gummi bears may be an effective alternative method for administering xylitol to children. Another double-blind, placebo-controlled trial studied 1,677 children in a comparison of standard fluoride toothpaste with a similar toothpaste containing 10% xylitol. Over the course of the 3-year study, children given xylitol-enriched toothpaste developed significantly fewer cavities than those in the fluoride-only group.

UPDATE spree_taxons SET description='Erythritol is a natural sugar alcohol with a clean sweet taste, and is used as a sugar substitute. Erythritol in its pure form is a white crystalline powder, not unlike sugar. It is about 70% as sweet as sugar, but has virtually no calories. Many sites claim erythritol is 0 calories, but in reality it is 0.2 calories per gram, almost 99% LESS than sugar. Because the calorie count is so small, for labeling purposes erythritol has 0 calorie value. One of the great things about erythritol is the fact it does not affect blood sugar levels (Low Glycemic Index). According to many clinical studies, erythritol has also demonstrated it does not affect blood serum glucose OR insulin levels. This has allowed many researchers to conclude that erythritol may be safely used to replace sucrose in foods designed specifically for people with diabetes. Like xylitol and other sugar alcohols, erythritol is actively resistant to oral bacteria, which is the main cause of tooth decay and bad breath. The FDA has approved use of the "Does Not Promote Tooth Decay" health claim in foods containing erythritol.
