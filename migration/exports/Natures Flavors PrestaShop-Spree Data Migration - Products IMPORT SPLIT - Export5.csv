NF-9304/NATP,"Maple Pancake Syrup Powder, Sugar-Free ","<p><div><strong>History</strong></div>
<p>Maple syrup may have started to be made long before recorded history; by the Native Americans in what is now Canada. The natives would use their tomahawks to make V-shaped incisions in the trees and record their sweet sap, then boil it in clay pots over an open fire. Over time, the Native sugar shacks became traditional gathering places, where people would meet up after a long day growing crops and hunting and they would share the meal they had prepared. So deep is Canada's love affair with the delicious maple syrup, that a maple leaf is prominently featured on the nation's flag. We at Nature's Flavors, on the other hand, are celebrating its sweet taste by carefully preparing our SweetenFX Maple Flavor Syrup- with all the deliciousness of fresh maple syrup with much less of the calories. SweetenFX Maple Flavor Syrup is made with a mix of two natural sweeteners- stevia, extracted from a shrub that grows wild in Latin America, and erythritol made from fermented sugar cane. SweetenFX Maple Flavor Syrup and fluffy Canadian pancakes go together like peanut butter and jelly; if you'd like to experience some new and less usual Flavors on your pancakes- then you could try <a>Erythritol Caramel Corn Coffee Syrup</a> and fresh banana slices, <a>Erythritol Panettone Flavor Syrup</a>; to which, if desired, you can add chopped walnuts or <a>Erythritol Panettone Flavor Syrup</a> and fruits of your choice. There's plenty to choose from!</p>
<div><strong>Folklore</strong></div>
<p>Shrove Tuesday ( Mardi Gras, and Fat Tuesday) is the day preceding Ash Wednesday, the first day of Lent; for many of us, especially those living in Europe or Canada- or who are of European or Canadian origin- this is better known as Pancake Day. In England, some towns celebrate the occasion with street mob football games. More commonly, pancake races, in which contestants carry frying pans with pancakes on them are held in villages and towns. Legend says that the tradition originated with a housewife from Olney, who was so busy making pancakes that she forgot the time until she heard the church bells ringing for service; so she had to rush out, while still carrying her pan and pancakes. Still, we'd say the best way to celebrate Pancake Day is with a good dash of SweetenFX Maple Flavor Syrup and a little bit of butter on Canadian pancakes; running around with the frying pan is optional.</p>
<div><strong>Daily Uses</strong></div>
<p>SweetenFX Maple Flavor Syrup is great as a topping for pancakes; to which you can add not just butter, but also fresh banana slices, chopped nuts, or other fillings of your choice. It also works great as a topping for ice creams and sundaes- particularly in combination with whipped cream and the nutty ice cream Flavors, such as walnut or hazelnut. SweetenFX Maple Flavor Syrup is also a good ingredient for cooking- you could add, for instance, a little bit of SweetenFX Maple Flavor Syrup to your favorite sauces and stuffings, to add a little bit of flavor. You can even use SweetenFX Maple Flavor Syrup in baking- we love it in simple shortbread cookies, blended, if desired, with a little bit of <a>Organic French Vanilla Coffee Syrup (Kosher, Vegan, Soy, and Gluten-Free)</a>; or in whiskey fruitcake dough. You can also use SweetenFX Maple Flavor Syrup to sweeten creams and custards, as well as to top baked apples or other similar desserts. Better yet, why not let us know yourself what great uses you've found for it?</p>
<div><strong>Health Benefits</strong></div>
<p>Maple syrup is a staple of breakfast and desserts for many of us. However, pure maple syrup has a glycemic index value of 54, which means a moderate effect of blood glucose levels; which is OK for most of us, in reasonable doses, but not for diabetics. SweetenFX Maple Flavor Syrup, on the other hand, is sweetened with SweetenFX- a blend of stevia and erythritol which has practically no calories and will not affect your blood sugar levels; which means that you can enjoy SweetenFX Maple Flavor Syrup even if you suffer from diabetes or try to lose weight. Sounds good to you? Then go ahead and give SweetenFX Maple Flavor Syrup a try!

<p>Simultaneously discovered by Emil Fischer in Germany, and M.G. Bertrand in France, in the late 19th century, Xylitol is a sugar alcohol that is naturally found in a variety of fibrous vegetables and fruits including various berries, oats, mushrooms, corn husk, sugar cane and more recently, birch trees. Xylitol is a natural sweetener that looks and tastes like sugar with many exceptional benefits.</p>
<p><strong>*** Great Taste</strong> - Other sugar alcohols like sorbitol, lactitol, mannitol, maltitol, or erythritol are only a fraction of the sweetness as sugar. Xylitol, however, is just as sweet as sugar and does not require any other synthetic sweeteners to give a great sweet taste. Nature&rsquo;s Flavors Xylitol Syrup doesn't use any synthetic sweeteners to give a great 100% natural flavor.</p>
<p><strong>*** Lower Calories</strong> - Xylitol has about 40% fewer calories than sugar, with all the great taste! No nasty after taste and great for anyone who is on a diet, watching their calories, or just wants to be healthier. Although this product contains carbohydrates, many people don't count these carbohydrates because they have a minimal effect on blood glucose levels and have a lower calorie amount per gram. These products, in effect, have low Net Effective Carbs. Suitable for Diabetics- Xylitol also has a low glycemic index value of only 7, has minimal effect on blood sugar levels, and does not require insulin to metabolize. Nature&rsquo;s Flavors Xylitol Syrups aren&rsquo;t only effective for those with diabetes or people with hypoglycemia, but for anyone who is sensitive to sugar.</p>
<p><strong>*** Known to combat and repair cavities</strong> - Xylitol is a good sugar alternative for everyone because it is beneficial for dental health. Xylitol helps reduce dental cavities, plaque, and tooth decay. Studies have shown that Xylitol is actually cariostatic, in other words, it reduces new tooth decay by inhibiting plaque and suppressing decay-causing bacteria. A study further suggested this was due to Xylitol&rsquo;s ability to decrease acidity created by bacteria in the mouth to a pH upwards of 7, making the saliva more basic. Alkaline, or basic, saliva has been shown to have increased saliva flow, and increased calcium and phosphate levels. The increased levels of calcium and phosphate travel to areas that are deficient like those areas of an emerging cavity. This may lead to the regeneration and hardening of teeth combating cavities. By switching to Nature&rsquo;s Flavors Xylitol Syrups, you may actually help damaged teeth grow stronger!</p>
<p><strong>*** Helps clear nasal passages and fight ear infections</strong> &ndash; Some studies have shown that adding specific quantities of Xylitol to saline nasal sprays increases the effectiveness in clearing and moisturizing nasal passages. A study suggests that bacteria adhere to tissue by forming sugar adhesion complexes. The ability for Xylitol to form many different sugar structures seems to disrupt bacterial ability to adhere to tissue and therefore inhibit bacterial propagation. The actual process of chewing Xlyitol gum may prevent ear infections by clearing the middle ear of earwax. Recent studies suggest that Xylitol destroys bacteria that may cause ear infections and ulcers and may even help strengthen bones.</p>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve read about the exceptional benefits of Xylitol, try it in a variety of Nature&rsquo;s Flavors Xylitol Syrups. Because we recognized the great benefits of Xylitol and were the <strong>FIRST</strong> to distribute Xylitol Syrups on the internet, you can be sure to trust the quality of <strong>Nature&rsquo;s Flavors Xylitol Syrups.</strong></p>

<p><br /> The sweet flavor of sugar without the sugar! Xylitol is an all-natural sweetener that is extracted from fruits, berries, lettuce, hardwoods and other plants. Xylitol is from a group of sweeteners that are often used in food called sugar alcohols or polyols. These in fact are not either sugar or alcohols, but natural compounds formed from sugars.<br /><br /> Xylitol is a NATURAL sweetener that looks and tastes like sugar with many exceptional benefits: <br /><br /><br /><br /> Great Taste- Other sugar alcohols like sorbitol, lactitol, mannitol, maltitol, or erythritol are only a fraction of the sweetness as sugar. Xylitol, however, is just as sweet as sugar and does not require any other synthetic sweeteners to give a great sweet taste. The competition may also use these sugar alcohols but may still include synthetic sweeteners to increase the sweetness. Xylitol doesn't need any synthetic sweeteners to give a great 100% natural flavor.<br /><br /> Lower Calories- Xylitol has about 40% lower calories than sugar, with all the great taste! It is good for anyone who is on a diet, watching their calories, or just wants to be healthier. Although this product contains carbohydrates, many people don't count these carbohydrates because they have a minimal effect on blood glucose levels and have a lower calorie amount per gram. These products, in effect, have low Net Effective Carbs.<br /><br /> Suitable for Diabetics- Xylitol also has a low glycemic index value of only 7, has minimal effect on blood sugar levels, and does not require insulin to metabolize. It is not only effective for those with diabetes or people with hypoglycemia, but for anyone who is sensitive to sugar.<br /><br /> Good Dental Health- Xylitol is a good sugar alternative for everyone because it is beneficial for dental health. Xylitol helps reduce dental cavities, plaque, and tooth decay. Studies have shown that Xylitol is actually cariostatic, in other words, it reduces new tooth decay by inhibiting plaque and suppressing decay-causing bacteria. By switching to xylitol products, you may actually help damaged teeth grow stronger.<br /><br /> No problems in digestion- You may have heard of other sugar alcohols or seen labels on products that warn of a laxative effect. Most other sugar alcohols such as sorbitol, mannitol, maltitol, isomalt, or lactitol may cause digestion problems. This is not the case for Xylitol!!! Xylitol is the sugar alcohol of choice because is as sweet as sugar, a natural choice, with no side effects like the others.<br /><br /> Other Great Advantages- Although Xylitol has been used as a sweetener since the 1960's in the United States, there are recent studies that confirm that it is more than just a great tasting low-calorie alternative to sugar. Xylitol destroys bacteria that may cause ear infections and ulcers and may even help strengthen bones. <br /><br /> Ingredients: Water, Xylitol, Xanthan gum, Natural Color, Organic flavors, Citric Acid, Sodium Benzoate, Potassium Sorbate</p>",01/06/2022,,61.22,Default,Xylitol Syrup Base,"Xylitol Syrup Base (Kosher, Vegan, Gluten Free)  Natures Flavors  The finest organic and Natural ingredients.

02801/C,"Almond Coffee Syrup Powder, Sweetened with Xylitol","<p>Simultaneously discovered by Emil Fischer in Germany, and M.G. Bertrand in France, in the late 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century, Xylitol is a sugar alcohol that is naturally found in a variety of fibrous vegetables and fruits including various berries, oats, mushrooms, corn husk, sugar cane and more recently, birch trees. Xylitol is a natural sweetener that looks and tastes like sugar with many exceptional benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>***&nbsp;<strong>Great Taste</strong>&nbsp;- Other sugar alcohols like sorbitol, lactitol, mannitol, maltitol, or erythritol are only a fraction of the sweetness as sugar. Xylitol, however, is just as sweet as sugar and does not require any other synthetic sweeteners to give a great sweet taste. Nature&rsquo;s Flavors Xylitol Syrup doesn't use any synthetic sweeteners to give a great 100% natural flavor.</p>
<p>***&nbsp;<strong>Lower Calories</strong>&nbsp;- Xylitol has about 40% fewer calories than sugar, with all the great taste! No nasty after taste and great for anyone who is on a diet, watching their calories, or just wants to be healthier. Although this product contains carbohydrates, many people don't count these carbohydrates because they have a minimal effect on blood glucose levels and have a lower calorie amount per gram. These products, in effect, have low Net Effective Carbs. Suitable for Diabetics- Xylitol also has a low glycemic index value of only 7, has minimal effect on blood sugar levels, and does not require insulin to metabolize. Nature&rsquo;s Flavors Xylitol Syrups aren&rsquo;t only effective for those with diabetes or people with hypoglycemia, but for anyone who is sensitive to sugar.</p>
<p>***&nbsp;<strong>Known to combat and repair cavities</strong>&nbsp;- Xylitol is a good sugar alternative for everyone because it is beneficial for dental health. Xylitol helps reduce dental cavities, plaque, and tooth decay. Studies have shown that Xylitol is actually cariostatic, in other words, it reduces new tooth decay by inhibiting plaque and suppressing decay-causing bacteria. A study further suggested this was due to Xylitol&rsquo;s ability to decrease acidity created by bacteria in the mouth to a pH upwards of 7, making the saliva more basic. Alkaline, or basic, saliva has been shown to have increased saliva flow, and increased calcium and phosphate levels. The increased levels of calcium and phosphate travel to areas that are deficient like those areas of an emerging cavity. This may lead to the regeneration and hardening of teeth combating cavities. By switching to Nature&rsquo;s Flavors Xylitol Syrups, you may actually help damaged teeth grow stronger!</p>
<p>***&nbsp;<strong>Helps clear nasal passages and fight ear infections</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Some studies have shown that adding specific quantities of Xylitol to saline nasal sprays increases the effectiveness in clearing and moisturizing nasal passages. A study suggests that bacteria adhere to tissue by forming sugar adhesion complexes. The ability for Xylitol to form many different sugar structures seems to disrupt bacterial ability to adhere to tissue and therefore inhibit bacterial propagation. The actual process of chewing Xlyitol gum may prevent ear infections by clearing the middle ear of earwax. Recent studies suggest that Xylitol destroys bacteria that may cause ear infections and ulcers and may even help strengthen bones.</p>

<p>Simultaneously discovered by Emil Fischer in Germany, and M.G. Bertrand in France, in the late 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century, Xylitol is a sugar alcohol that is naturally found in a variety of fibrous vegetables and fruits including various berries, oats, mushrooms, corn husk, sugar cane and more recently, birch trees. Xylitol is a natural sweetener that looks and tastes like sugar with many exceptional benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>***&nbsp;Great Taste&nbsp;- Other sugar alcohols like sorbitol, lactitol, mannitol, maltitol, or erythritol are only a fraction of the sweetness as sugar. Xylitol, however, is just as sweet as sugar and does not require any other synthetic sweeteners to give a great sweet taste. Nature' Flavors Xylitol Syrup doesn' use any synthetic sweeteners to give a great 100% natural flavor.</p>
<p>***&nbsp;Lower Calories&nbsp;- Xylitol has about 40% fewer calories than sugar, with all the great taste! No nasty after taste and great for anyone who is on a diet, watching their calories, or just wants to be healthier. Although this product contains carbohydrates, many people don' count these carbohydrates because they have a minimal effect on blood glucose levels and have a lower calorie amount per gram. These products, in effect, have low Net Effective Carbs. Suitable for Diabetics- Xylitol also has a low glycemic index value of only 7, has minimal effect on blood sugar levels, and does not require insulin to metabolize. Nature' Flavors Xylitol Syrups aren' only effective for those with diabetes or people with hypoglycemia, but for anyone who is sensitive to sugar.</p>
<p>***&nbsp;Known to combat and repair cavities&nbsp;- Xylitol is a good sugar alternative for everyone because it is beneficial for dental health. Xylitol helps reduce dental cavities, plaque, and tooth decay. Studies have shown that Xylitol is actually cariostatic, in other words, it reduces new tooth decay by inhibiting plaque and suppressing decay-causing bacteria. A study further suggested this was due to Xylitol' ability to decrease acidity created by bacteria in the mouth to a pH upwards of 7, making the saliva more basic. Alkaline, or basic, saliva has been shown to have increased saliva flow, and increased calcium and phosphate levels. The increased levels of calcium and phosphate travel to areas that are deficient like those areas of an emerging cavity. This may lead to the regeneration and hardening of teeth combating cavities. By switching to Nature' Flavors Xylitol Syrups, you may actually help damaged teeth grow stronger!</p>
<p>***&nbsp;Helps clear nasal passages and fight ear infections&nbsp;&ndash; Some studies have shown that adding specific quantities of Xylitol to saline nasal sprays increases the effectiveness in clearing and moisturizing nasal passages. A study suggests that bacteria adhere to tissue by forming sugar adhesion complexes. The ability for Xylitol to form many different sugar structures seems to disrupt bacterial ability to adhere to tissue and therefore inhibit bacterial propagation. The actual process of chewing Xlyitol gum may prevent ear infections by clearing the middle ear of earwax. Recent studies suggest that Xylitol destroys bacteria that may cause ear infections and ulcers and may even help strengthen bones.</p>
<p>Now that you' read about the exceptional benefits of Xylitol, try it in a variety of Nature' Flavors Xylitol Syrups.

02801/I,"Almond Italian Soda Syrup Powder, Sweetened with Xylitol ","<p>Simultaneously discovered by Emil Fischer in Germany, and M.G. Bertrand in France, in the late 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century, Xylitol is a sugar alcohol that is naturally found in a variety of fibrous vegetables and fruits including various berries, oats, mushrooms, corn husk, sugar cane and more recently, birch trees. Xylitol is a natural sweetener that looks and tastes like sugar with many exceptional benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>***&nbsp;<strong>Great Taste</strong>&nbsp;- Other sugar alcohols like sorbitol, lactitol, mannitol, maltitol, or erythritol are only a fraction of the sweetness as sugar. Xylitol, however, is just as sweet as sugar and does not require any other synthetic sweeteners to give a great sweet taste. Nature&rsquo;s Flavors Xylitol Syrup doesn't use any synthetic sweeteners to give a great 100% natural flavor.</p>
<p>***&nbsp;<strong>Lower Calories</strong>&nbsp;- Xylitol has about 40% fewer calories than sugar, with all the great taste! No nasty after taste and great for anyone who is on a diet, watching their calories, or just wants to be healthier. Although this product contains carbohydrates, many people don't count these carbohydrates because they have a minimal effect on blood glucose levels and have a lower calorie amount per gram. These products, in effect, have low Net Effective Carbs. Suitable for Diabetics- Xylitol also has a low glycemic index value of only 7, has minimal effect on blood sugar levels, and does not require insulin to metabolize. Nature&rsquo;s Flavors Xylitol Syrups aren&rsquo;t only effective for those with diabetes or people with hypoglycemia, but for anyone who is sensitive to sugar.</p>
<p>***&nbsp;<strong>Known to combat and repair cavities</strong>&nbsp;- Xylitol is a good sugar alternative for everyone because it is beneficial for dental health. Xylitol helps reduce dental cavities, plaque, and tooth decay. Studies have shown that Xylitol is actually cariostatic, in other words, it reduces new tooth decay by inhibiting plaque and suppressing decay-causing bacteria. A study further suggested this was due to Xylitol&rsquo;s ability to decrease acidity created by bacteria in the mouth to a pH upwards of 7, making the saliva more basic. Alkaline, or basic, saliva has been shown to have increased saliva flow, and increased calcium and phosphate levels. The increased levels of calcium and phosphate travel to areas that are deficient like those areas of an emerging cavity. This may lead to the regeneration and hardening of teeth combating cavities. By switching to Nature&rsquo;s Flavors Xylitol Syrups, you may actually help damaged teeth grow stronger!</p>
<p>***&nbsp;<strong>Helps clear nasal passages and fight ear infections</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Some studies have shown that adding specific quantities of Xylitol to saline nasal sprays increases the effectiveness in clearing and moisturizing nasal passages. A study suggests that bacteria adhere to tissue by forming sugar adhesion complexes. The ability for Xylitol to form many different sugar structures seems to disrupt bacterial ability to adhere to tissue and therefore inhibit bacterial propagation. The actual process of chewing Xlyitol gum may prevent ear infections by clearing the middle ear of earwax. Recent studies suggest that Xylitol destroys bacteria that may cause ear infections and ulcers and may even help strengthen bones.</p>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve read about the exceptional benefits of Xylitol, try it in a variety of Nature&rsquo;s Flavors Xylitol Syrups. Because we recognized the great benefits of Xylitol and were the&nbsp;<strong>FIRST</strong>&nbsp;to distribute Xylitol Syrups on the internet, you can be sure to trust the quality of Nature&rsquo;s Flavors Xylitol Syrups.</p>",01/06/2022,,61.22,Default,Almond Xylitol Italian Soda Syrup,Almond Xylitol Italian Soda Syrup  Natures Flavors  The finest organic and Natural ingredients.

<p><br /><br />These great pancake syrups are thick and delicious, the perfect treat without the sugar!! Besides pancakes, they can be used in waffles, French toast, other breakfast treats, desserts, or even drinks! Xylitol is the all natural sweetener that is extracted from fruits, berries, lettuce, hardwoods and other plants. Xylitol is from a group of sweeteners that are often used in food called sugar alcohols or polyols. These in fact are not either sugar or alcohols, but natural compounds formed from sugars. Xylitol is the NATURAL sweetener that looks and tastes like sugar with many exceptional benefits: Great Taste- Other sugar alcohols like sorbitol, lactitol, mannitol, maltitol, or erythritol are only a fraction of the sweetness as sugar. Xylitol, however, is just as sweet as sugar and does not require any other synthetic sweeteners to give a great sweet taste. The competition may also use these sugar alcohols but may still include synthetic sweeteners to increase the sweetness. Xylitol doesn't need any synthetic sweeteners to give a great 100% natural flavor. Lower Calories- Xylitol has about 40% lower calories than sugar, with all the great taste! It is good for anyone who is on a diet, watching their calories, or just wants to be healthier. Although this product contains carbohydrates, many people don't count these carbohydrates because they have a minimal effect on blood glucose levels and have a lower calorie amount per gram. These products, in effect, have low Net Effective Carbs. Suitable for Diabetics- Xylitol also has a low glycemic index value of only 7, has minimal effect on blood sugar levels, and does not require insulin to metabolize. It is not only effective for those with diabetes or people with hypoglycemia, but for anyone who is sensitive to sugar. Good Dental Health- Xylitol is a good sugar alternative for everyone because it is beneficial for dental health. Xylitol helps reduce dental cavities, plaque, and tooth decay. Studies have shown that Xylitol is actually cariostatic, in other words, it reduces new tooth decay by inhibiting plaque and suppressing decay-causing bacteria. By switching to xylitol products, you may actually help damaged teeth grow stronger. No problems in digestion- You may have heard of other sugar alcohols or seen labels on products that warn of a laxative effect. Most other sugar alcohols such as sorbitol, mannitol, maltitol, isomalt, or lactitol may cause digestion problems. This is not the case for Xylitol!!! Xylitol is the sugar alcohol of choice because is as sweet as sugar, a natural choice, with no side effects like the others. Other Great Advantages- Although Xylitol has been used as a sweetener since the 1960's in the United States, there are recent studies that confirm that it is more than just a great tasting low calorie alternative to sugar. Xylitol destroys bacteria that may cause ear infections and ulcers and may even help strengthen bones. Our Xylitol pancake syrups are available in 3 great tasting natural flavors with many more new flavors on the way. After you try these great tasting syrups, you'll be hooked on the NATURAL alternative!

Enjoy a strong coffee like the great kings of the Orient used to have in the afternoon, in company of their numerous wives and mistresses, flavoured with a good dash of Organic Banana Smoothie/Shake, or have some Organic Banana Smoothie/Shake&nbsp;on top of a delicious rosewater sorbet.<br /><br />""Musa Sapientum"" is the scientific name for the banana, which translates to ""fruit of the wise men."" There's a reason bananas are one of the most popular fruits on this planet. The banana is a great source of energy, potassium, magnesium, and vitamin&nbsp;B6.&nbsp;Packed with starch and dietary fibers, bananas&nbsp;can make your feeling of hunger go away. Buy the Organic Banana Smoothie/Shake&nbsp;and it will be like you are buying fresh bananas. All the benefits of it will certainly help you maintain a healthy and delicious life!<br /><br /><br />Organic Banana Smoothie/Shake&nbsp;is also delicious in strong, black, Turkish-style coffee, as well as in delicate coffee and milk drinks: try it in spiced lattes, blended frappucinos or simple iced coffee. You can also use it in milkshakes; blend a glass of milk with vanilla, hazelnut, almond or macadamia nut ice cream and a good dash of Organic Banana Smoothie/Shake. Or, you can try it in yogurt smoothies, in combination with fresh fruits, especially the exotic-ones; for example: mango, guava and mandarin orange; with maybe a few teaspoons of coconut cream for extra creamy flavor. You can also use it as an ice cream toping or flavouring; how about, for example, a nice sorbet with&nbsp;a little bit of orange flower water, topped with some lovely Organic Banana Smoothie/Shake? Or use Organic Banana Smoothie/Shake&nbsp;as a flavouring for a delicious ice cream, by stirring it in heavy cream and freezing it. Also stirred in whipped cream, it can flavour panna cota or various kinds of custards. Since it is heat resistant, you can even use it in baking, for muffins, cakes, scones or banana bread<br /><br /> <strong>Usage:</strong><br /> 8 ounces of milk or soy milk<br />8 ounces of ice<br />4 ounces of Nature's Flavors' Organic Banana Smoothie/Shake</p>",01/06/2022,,388.29,Default,Organic Banana Smoothie/Shake,"Organic Banana Smoothie/Shake (Kosher, Vegan, Gluten-Free)  Natures Flavors  The finest organic and Natural ingredients.

<p>Coconuts are the fruit of life. Coconuts are dynamic fruits that serve a variety of purposes. For centuries, the Coconut has been used as a form of nourishment and hydration. From drying Coconut to drinking Coconut milk, the Coconut has been in use for a long range of time. In fact, most historians are unsure about the Coconut's origins. A few different stories exist about the Coconut's origins. One story believes Coconuts came from an unknown island in the Indian Ocean, whereas another story believes Coconuts came directly from South America. Despite the speculation of the Coconut's origins, Coconuts are a vital part of many indigenous communities. South American tribes utilize the Coconut not only as a source of food and drink, but also as a means of survival. The hard Coconut shells are used as protectors or places to store small items. Coconut shells are sometimes used as apparel, too, in other rural, tribal areas. As Coconuts proved to be useful throughout the centuries, Coconuts continue to be a great source of nourishment for developing communities, as well as developed societies.</p>
<p>Coconuts are known for their excellent nutritional value. Consuming Coconuts reduces the total cholesterol levels in the body, while also providing the body a varied amount of nutrients, such as antiviral properties to help the immune system.</p>",01/06/2022,,79.34,Default,Coconut Smoothie Base,Coconut Smoothie Base  Natures Flavors  The finest organic and Natural ingredients.

<p>Chocolate is one of America's favorite flavors. But, how did America come to find the deliciousness of Chocolate? Where did this amazing flavor and taste come from? The chocolate flavor comes from the Cocoa tree. Cocoa trees produce Cocoa pods in which Chocolate flavor is extracted for food and drinks.</p>
<p>Mesoamerica&nbsp;became known as the central hub of Chocolate production as far back as 1900 B.C. Indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica known as the Mokaya were producing Chocolate flavored drinks and dishes for many years. The word spread of this delicious, comforting drink with healing properties. As awareness was brought about, a variety of Mesoamerican cultures started employing Chocolate for culinary and healing purposes. In particular, the Mayan and Aztec cultures of Mexico and Central America became prominent commercial points for Chocolate distribution and trade. Chocolate become entirely integrated into the culture of South America and Central America, as it was used for nourishment. When Spanish explorers and Missionaries arrived in the tropical oasis of South America and Central America, they were given drinks of Chocolate as a welcoming gift. The explorers were also given Cocoa Beans as a form of trade. Once Cocoa Beans and by-products such as Chocolate reached the Old World, Chocolate took on a whole new influence. From culinary creations to treatments, Chocolate was everywhere. Chocolate continues to be a prominent figure in today's culture as it is a widely enjoyed flavor.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, but Chocolate is good for you! Research has shown that patients who consumer Chocolate on a daily basis are more likely to live a longer, healthier life than those who do not consume Chocolate daily. Chocolate has a rich consistency of natural minerals, such as iron and magnesium which help keep the body's balance at normal levels. Chocolate also contains important antioxidants that promote a decrease in free radicals and an increase in a healthier complexion, as well as digestive wellness.</p>
<p>Nature's Flavors' Organic Chocolate Shake Base&nbsp;has a variety of uses. From shaved ice to baking confections, Nature's Flavors' Organic Chocolate Shake Base&nbsp;can be enjoyed year round.&nbsp;</p>

NF-4997/ORG,Organic Almond Flavored Coffee Beans,"<p>
We never use cheap coffee beans to make our organic flavored coffees. Only the finest organic coffee beans are good enough to be blended with our organic premium coffee flavors. We roast our organic Columbian coffee beans every day and flavor them to-order to ensure that they are at peak freshness when you receive them. Our organic almond flavor is carefully blended to bring out and augment both the almond and coffee flavor combined. If you prefer to make your own Organic Almond Flavored Coffee Beans, we also offer Organic Columbian Coffee Beans and Organic Almond Coffee Flavor for you to mix yourself. This can be done at a ratio of 1 pound of Organic Columbian Coffee Beans to 1 teaspoon of Organic Almond Coffee Flavoring. Allow the mixture to sit for twenty-four hours before grinding. This allows the flavor to completely migrate through the coffee beans and further enhance the flavor. Organic Almond Flavored Coffee Beans are also available as Organic Decaffeinated. Please look under the category for Organic Decaffeinated Flavored Coffee Beans or Decaffeinated Flavored Coffee Beans. Nature's Flavors has the largest selection of Organic Flavored Coffee Beans, Flavored Coffee Beans, Decaffeinated Flavored Coffee Beans, and Organic Decaffeinated Coffee Beans in the world.
