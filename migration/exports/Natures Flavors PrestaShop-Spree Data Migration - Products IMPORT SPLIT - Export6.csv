NF-8357/NAT,Vanilla Fragrance Oil Sante (Oil Soluble),"<p>This oil soluble fragrance can be used to make candles, soap, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, aromatherapy, massage oils, cologne, potpourri, light rings, kerosene, Tiki Lamps, and just about any other application that calls for an oil soluble fragrance. Nature's Flavors Sante Oil Soluble Fragrance Oils should NOT be used in any water based applications. For water based applications look for water soluble fragrance oils or emulsions like these. Starting usage levels range from about one to five percent. With cosmetics be sure and test the products in the soft skin portion of your arm around the elbow area to check for sensitivity if there are any signs of rash or itching than discontinue using these scents. When scenting candles, melt, and pour soaps, start with a a small amount as these oils are strong you can always add more. When making glycerin based soaps you should use the regular fragrance oils found in the aromatherapy section as these are more soluble in that application. You can use these oils to scent kerosene lanterns but use small amounts about 1 tsp per 8 ounces of kerosene. In massage oils use 2 two 3 drops per 8 ounces to start and work up from there to get to the desired level. We recommend you not use cinnamon or cherry on any application that touches human skin as irritation may occur. Nature's Flavors has created one of the largest collections of Oil Soluble Fragrances in the world. This vast selection of Fragrances is available for everyone from individuals, to fellow manufacturers. Since we make these fragrances right here in Orange, California, we can offer these superior fragrance oils at very competitive prices. We search the world over for the finest and most unusual ingredients to make these delicate scents. Many of these natural scents are formulated with essential oils and true flower essences such as gardenia, jasmine, and roses. As we continue to build Natures Fragrances, we will always keep an ear out for suggestions from our customers to help deliver the most diverse selection! We have been making Powdered, and Liquid - Water Soluble, and Liquid - Oil Soluble Fragrances for over twenty five years. Nature's Flavors Fragrances are heat stable and highly concentrated so a little goes a long way. Fragrance Oils are best used in applications where an oil soluble liquid fragrance is desired. For Water Based applications we recommend using our Water Soluble Fragrance Oils, instead of this Oil Soluble Fragrance. If you don't see a fragrance or flavor that you need you can request it.

NF-8279NAT,"Acai Compound, Natural","<p>Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified organic flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% organic flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own organic ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of organic and natural flavors are filtered RO water and organic alcohol. If we cant extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employ. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take organic vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an organic alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard organic vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its organic vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the organic flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based organic flavor concentrate. To make the organic flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an organic gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest organic flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these organic products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our organic products. We hope they bring you much enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>",01/06/2022,,198.37,,Default,Acai Compound | All Natural,Our Natural Acai Compound uses only the finest organic ingredients.

NF-6667/NAT,Coconut Super Concentrated Flavor Powder (3X Fold),<p>This flavor is moderately heat stable. It brings out a well rounded flavor in these applications. Starting usages should be 1 to 5% depending on how long you cook and how high the temp but you may use even less flavor in some applications due to the nature of the flavor and the make up of the formula ingredients you are using. It is not uncommon to see usages of less than 1% and .1% could be your finished usage. You will have to experiment with each flavor as they can all vary.

Natures Flavours' Organic Antioxidant with Rosemary was created for products with the ability to go rancid quickly.<br> Many people are familiar with the negative taste associated with rancid vegetable oil. It can ruin a salad dressing or the creation of that special massage oil. This Organic Antioxidant will not stop or prevent oxidation - nothing on this planet will do that. Nevertheless, it will slow down oxidation and the effects oxidation has on food products, usually long enough for you or the consumer of your products to use them up.

NF-6260/OCFO,Organic Caramel Cream Coffee and Tea Flavoring,"<p>This Organic Flavoring System can also be used to flavor any type of water soluble liquid. All of our Certified Organic Coffee and Tea Flavors are all natural, Kosher, Vegan, Gluten Free, and contain NO Allergens! Nature's Flavors Organic Coffee and Tea Flavoring Systems are water soluble, in addition they will mix into Glycerin, and Propylene Glycol solutions even better than our Organic Flavor Extracts. To add Caramel Cream Flavor to your own Coffee Beans, Tea Leaves, and other dried Herbs, simply take one pound of roasted coffee beans and one-half of a teaspoon of your favorite Nature's Flavors Organic Flavoring System for Coffee and Tea and sprinkle it over your beans. For the most even distribution we use a sprayer, instead of sprinkling. Once you have distributed your Flavor over your Coffee, we recommend that you place these newly flavored beans within a seal-able container like a mason jar, old coffee can, or a zip lock back, then shake it up to help spread the flavor out, and then let the sealed container sit for 24 hours to allow the flavors to permeate the coffee or tea. Nature's Flavors has recently renamed our Organic Flavor Oils for Coffee and Tea (Organic Coffee and Tea Flavoring Oils) to Organic Flavoring Systems for Coffee and Tea (Organic Coffee and Tea Flavoring Systems) due to the fact that the name Flavor Oil was misleading. Nature's Flavors Coffee and Tea Flavoring Systems are not set in an oil base, and are not oil soluble. They are a direct evolution from our Flavor Extracts.<br><br> Like our Flavor Extracts they are set in an alcohol base, in addition, these Organic Flavoring Systems also include a vegetable glycerin component to help the flavors permeate the coffee beans and/or tea leaves. It will evaporate out of the beans or herbs usually with in the first 24 hours you will smell a little alcohol when you first open the sealed container, any remaining alcohol will burn off immediately when you brew the coffee or tea. These flavors have no nutritional value as used in this application are calorie, carb, and sugar free. There is no fat. Enjoy. Ingredients: Organic Flavors, Vegetable Glycerin, and Organic Ethyl Alcohol. The processes for making organic flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are organic rather than just natural. You start by using only certified organic ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% organic. When calling it 100% organic you must use only certified organic ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified organic flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% organic flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own organic ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of organic and natural flavors are filtered RO water and organic alcohol. If we can’t extract the ingredients through these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employ. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take organic vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an organic alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard organic vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its organic vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the organic flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based organic flavor concentrate.<br><br> To make the organic flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an organic gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gum's to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest organic flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these organic products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our organic products. We hope they bring you much enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>",01/06/2022,,264.51,,Default,Organic Caramel Cream Coffee and Tea Flavoring,Organic Caramel Cream Coffee and Tea Flavoring  Natures Flavors  The finest organic and Natural ingredients.
