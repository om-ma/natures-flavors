This flavor is excellent for baking at about 1-5% usage, depending on how hot and how long you bake it for. It is good in ice cream, sorbets, icees, shakes, sauces, beverages, puddings, and yogurts.<br /><br /> Discovered to be a great fever reducer, quinine was first extracted by the Quechua Indians of Peru from the bark of cinchona trees to help reduce fevers. They would grind the bark and mix it with water to offset its bitterness, thereby creating the first tonic water. Jesuit missionaries first arrived in the New World in the early 17th century, and were introduced to the bark and it’s anti-fever properties. The bark became known as 'Peruvian Bark', and the tree was named Cinchona after the wife of the Viceroy of Peru, the Countess of Chinchón, was cured of her fever after being treated by the curative properties of the bark.<br /><br /> Having seen the anti-fever properties of the Peruvian bark, Jesuit missionaries returned to Europe and introduced Peruvian Bark as an anti-fever compound. The bark was dried and ground to a fine powder, and then mixed into a liquid for use. With malaria ravaging Europe, it quickly became one of the most valuable commodities shipped from Peru to Europe as a treatment against malaria, creating a high demand for the cinchona tree. This gave rise to a Spanish-controlled monopoly that dominated the sought after resource and led to the gradual decrease and overharvesting of the natural cinchona forest.<br /><br /> Quinine remained elusive until the early 1800s when French Chemist sought the active compound that reduced fevers. In 1820, French pharmacists, Pierre-Joseph Pelletier and Joseph-Bienaimé isolated and extracted the alkaloid, quinine, naming it after the Inca word for the cinchona bark, Quechua.<br /><br /> As Europe expanded and colonized into malaria-infested regions, so did the demand for quinine. In order to maintain their monopoly, Peru outlawed the exportation of cinchona seeds and saplings with little avail, as the Dutch cultivated plantations from smuggled seeds, resulted in approximately 97% of the world’s quinine production. During World War II, the allies were cut off from their supply of quinine when the Germans invaded the Netherlands and the Japanese occupied the Philippines and Indonesia. Due to the allies fighting in malaria-infested territory and limited availability of quinine, American scientists eagerly worked to synthetically create quinine. In desperation, the United States opened cinchona plantations in Costa Rica, but were unable to harvest in time leading to thousands of lost American lives due to malaria.</p>",01/06/2022,,34.38,Default,Quinine Flavor Concentrate,Quinine Flavor Concentrate  Natures Flavors  The finest organic and Natural ingredients.

NF-5704/NAT/ND,Almond Flavor Concentrate Without Diacetyl,"<p>Originating in the Middle East and South East Asia, the almond was transported throughout the world in ancient times and continues to be greatly produced. The United States is the largest almond producer in the world. Nature's Flavors' Almond Flavor Concentrate can be used in baking since the almond is heat stable up to 375 degrees for up to one hour. This Almond Flavor Concentrate works well in dairy applications such as ice cream and yogurt, milk and milk shakes, and protein drinks. Nature's Flavors' allspice flavor concentrate is very strong-- a little goes a long way. Care should be taken to not use too much or over-flavor a product. If you taste the flavor longer than 3 to 5 seconds on your palate, or if you experience a metallic or taste, then you have over-flavored the product, meaning you will be burping allspice for up to an hour after consumption. Nature's Flavors' Almond Favor provides additional uses as a flavoring for pies, cakes, pastries and cookies, and can be used as a low quantity replacer of almond paste. Remember, more is not always better. Use just enough to tease the taste buds and avoid overwhelming yourself or your customer with too much flavor. Over-flavoring usually means you will become tired of the flavor quickly and probably never use it again. Blending our Vanilla Extract or Vanilla Flavor Concentrate with the Almond Flavor Concentrate will smooth out the flavor, and enhance it so you will need less flavor to smooth out any rough edges in the taste. Vanilla extracts act like an enhancer much the same way as cream and sugar are to coffee.

NF-2060/NAT/ND,Quinine Flavor Concentrate Without Diacetyl,"<p>Discovered to be a great fever reducer, Quinine was first extracted by Quechua Indians of Peru from the bark of cinchona trees to help reduce fevers. They would grind the bark and mix it with water to offset the bitterness of the bark, thereby creating the first tonic water. Jesuit missionaries first arrived in the New World in the early 17th century, and were introduced to the bark and it’s anti-fever properties. The bark became known as the Peruvian bark, and the tree was named Cinchona after the wife of the Viceroy of Peru, the Countess of Chinchón, who was cured of her fever after being treated by the curative properties of the bark. Having seen the anti-fever properties of the Peruvian bark, Jesuit missionaries returned to Europe and introduced the Peruvian bark as an anti-fever compound in the late 17th century. The bark was dried and ground up to a fine powder, and then mixed into a liquid for use. With malaria ravaging Europe, it quickly became one of the most valuable commodities shipped from Peru to Europe as a treatment against malaria, creating a high demand for the cinchona tree. This gave rise to a Spanish-controlled monopoly that dominated the sought after resource and led to the gradual decrease and overharvesting of the natural cinchona forest. Quinine remained elusive until the early 1800s when French Chemist sought the active compound that reduced fevers. In 1820, French pharmacists, Pierre-Joseph Pelletier and Joseph-Bienaimé isolated and extracted the alkaloid, quinine, naming it after the Inca word for the cinchona bark, Quechua.As Europe expanded and colonized into malaria-infested regions, so did the demand for quinine. In order to maintain their monopoly, Peru outlawed the exportation of cinchona seeds and saplings with little avail, as the Dutch cultivated plantations from smuggled seeds, resulted in approximately 97% of the world’s quinine production.During World War II, the allies were cut off from their supply of quinine when the Germans invaded the Netherlands and the Japanese occupied the Philippines and Indonesia. Due to the allies fighting in malaria-infested territory and limited availability of quinine, American scientists eagerly worked to synthetically create quinine. In desperation, the United States opened cinchona plantations in Costa Rica, but were unable to harvest in time leading to thousands of lost American lives due to malaria. Quinine was the anti-malarial of choice up the 1940s in which better anti-malarial were developed. As of 2004, it has been replaced as the primary modality of dealing with malaria according to WHO, but is still used to some in impoverished regions to some extent. To this day, quinine is most profitably harvested from the cinchona tree for the food industry, despite advances in synthesis of quinine, however synthetic quinine and analogues are used ly as they are more effective and have fewer side effects than quinine. In some cases, quinine has been shown to alleviate muscle cramps. Quinine’s biological mechanism of action is still unknown; however the model of a closely related anti-malarial drug, Chloroquine, may provide insight. In treating malaria, once chloroquine is ingested, it accumulates and is trapped in patient’s parasitic red blood cell. The heme molecule, under parasitic influence, causes the heme in the blood cells to crystallize leading to the eventual destruction and propagation of the disease. Chloroquine instead, binds to the excess heme forming a toxic complex that will destroy the cell and the parasitic infection.

To add flavor to your coffee beans, tea leaves, and other dried herbs, simply sprinkle one-half teaspoon of Nature's Flavors' Coffee and Tea Flavoring System over one pound of roasted coffee, tea, or herbs. For the most even distribution, we use a sprayer. Once you have distributed the flavor over your coffee, we recommend you place these newly flavored beans within a sealable container like a mason jar, old coffee can, or a zip-lock bag. After it has been sealed, shake it vigorously to help even out the flavor. Let the sealed container sit for 24 hours to allow the flavors to permeate the coffee or tea. Nature's Flavors has recently renamed our Flavor Oils for Coffee and Tea, or Coffee and Tea Flavoring Oils, to Flavoring Systems for Coffee and Tea, or Coffee and Tea Flavoring Systems, due to the fact the name Flavor Oil was misleading. Nature's Flavors' Coffee and Tea Flavoring Systems are not set in an oil base, and are not oil soluble. They are a direct evolution from our Flavor Extracts. Like our Flavor Extracts, there is a small amount of alcohol added to help the flavors permeate the coffee beans or tea leaves. It will evaporate out of the beans or herbs usually within the first 24 hours. You will smell a little alcohol when you first open the sealed container. Any remaining alcohol will burn off immediately when you brew the coffee or tea. These flavors contain no nutritional value as used in this application and are calorie, carb, and sugar free with no fat. Enjoy.

NF-5880/CFO,Japanese Plum Coffee and Tea Flavoring,"<p>Nature's Flavors Coffee &amp; Tea Flavoring Systems are water soluble, in addition they will mix into Glycerin, and Propylene Glycol solutions even better than our Flavor Extracts. To add Japanese Plum Flavor to your own Coffee Beans, Tea Leaves, and other dried Herbs, simply take one pound of roasted coffee beans and one-half of a teaspoon of your favorite Nature's Flavors Flavoring System for Coffee and Tea and sprinkle it over your beans. For the most even distribution we use a sprayer, instead of sprinkling. Once you have distributed your Flavor over your Coffee, we recommend that you place these newly flavored beans within a seal-able container like a mason jar, old coffee can, or a zip lock back, then shake it up to help spread the flavor out, and then let the sealed container sit for 24 hours to allow the flavors to permeate the coffee or tea. Nature's Flavors has recently renamed our Flavor Oils for Coffee and Tea ( Coffee and Tea Flavoring Oils) to Flavoring Systems for Coffee and Tea (Coffee and Tea Flavoring Systems) due to the fact that the name Flavor Oil was misleading. Nature's Flavors Coffee and Tea Flavoring Systems are not set in an oil base, and are not oil soluble. They are a direct evolution from our Flavor Extracts. Like our Flavor Extracts they are set in an alcohol base, in addition, these Flavoring Systems also include a vegetable glycerin component to help the flavors permeate the coffee beans and/or tea leaves. It will evaporate out of the beans or herbs usually with in the first 24 hours you will smell a little alcohol when you first open the sealed container, any remaining alcohol will burn off immediately when you brew the coffee or tea. These flavors have no nutritional value as used in this application are calorie, carb, and sugar free. There is no fat. Enjoy. Ingredients: Flavors, Vegetable Glycerin, and Ethyl Alcohol. The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% . When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients through these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employ. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gum's to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products. We hope they bring you much enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>",01/06/2022,,46.28,Default,Japanese Plum Coffee and Tea Flavoring,Japanese Plum Coffee and Tea Flavoring  Natures Flavors  The finest organic and Natural ingredients.

All of our Coffee and Tea Flavoring systems are Kosher, Vegan, Gluten Free, and contain NO Allergens! To add Flavor to your own Coffee Beans, Tea Leaves, and other dried Herbs, simply take one pound of roasted coffee beans and one-half of a teaspoon of your favorite Nature's Flavors' Coffee and Tea Flavoring System and sprinkle it over your beans. For the most even distribution we use a sprayer, instead of sprinkling.

All of our Coffee and Tea Flavoring systems are Kosher, Vegan, Gluten Free, and contain NO Allergens! To add Flavor to your own Coffee Beans, Tea Leaves, and other dried Herbs, simply take one pound of roasted coffee beans and one-half of a teaspoon of your favorite Nature's Flavors' Coffee and Tea Flavoring System and sprinkle it over your beans. For the most even distribution we use a sprayer, instead of sprinkling. Once you have distributed your Flavor over your Coffee, we recommend that you place these newly flavored beans within a seal-able container like a mason jar, old coffee can, or a zip lock back, then shake it up to help spread the flavor out, and then let the sealed container sit for 24 hours to allow the flavors to permeate the coffee or tea.

The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% . When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Natures Flavours carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients through these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employee. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Natures Flavours allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gum's to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Natures Flavours has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products. We hope they bring you much enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>",01/06/2022,,39.68,Default,Japanese Plum Coffee and Tea Flavoring Without Diacetyl,Japanese Plum Coffee and Tea Flavoring - Without Diacetyl  Natures Flavors  The finest organic and Natural ingredients.

All of our Coffee and Tea Flavoring systems are Kosher, Vegan, Gluten Free, and contain NO Allergens! To add Menthol Flavor to your own Coffee Beans, Tea Leaves, and other dried Herbs, simply take one pound of roasted coffee beans and one-half of a teaspoon of your favorite Natures Flavours' Menthol Coffee and Tea Flavoring System and sprinkle it over your beans. For the most even distribution we use a sprayer, instead of sprinkling. Once you have distributed your Flavor over your Coffee, we recommend that you place these newly flavored beans within a seal-able container like a mason jar, old coffee can, or a zip lock back, then shake it up to help spread the flavor out, and then let the sealed container sit for 24 hours to allow the flavors to permeate the coffee or tea.

It will evaporate out of the beans or herbs usually with in the first 24 hours you will smell a little alcohol when you first open the sealed container, any remaining alcohol will burn off immediately when you brew the coffee or tea. In the case of Vaping these flavors, the alcohol will provide a very light and rich throat hit. These flavors have no nutritional value as used in this application are calorie, carb, and sugar free.
