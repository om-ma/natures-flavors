NF-7208/NAT/ND,"Allspice Extract, without Diacetyl","<p>The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% organic. When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavours carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients through these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employee. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavours allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and Gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts.

NF-8219/ND,Citrus Flavor Extract Without Diacetyl,"<p>Citrus Flavor Extract For Beverages The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% organic. When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Natures Flavours carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employee. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Natures Flavours allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Natures Flavours has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products. We hope they bring you much enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>",01/06/2022,,25.39,Default,Citrus Flavor Extract Without Diacetyl,Flavor the way nature intended.

NF-8372/ND,Elderflower Flavor Extract Without Diacetyl,"<p>Elderflower Flavor Extract (Kosher, Vegan, Gluten Free) is a water soluble, clear, liquid flavoring. This Flavor Extract is excellent for baking, ice cream, coffee syrups and in beverage applications! Nature's Flavours Allspice Flavor Extract is Kosher, Vegan, and Gluten Free. The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% organic. When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavours carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients through these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employee. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavours allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and Gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavours has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products. We hope they bring you much enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>",01/06/2022,,25.39,Default,Elderflower Flavor Extract Without Diacetyl,Elderflower Flavor Extract Without Diacetyl  Natures Flavors  The finest organic and Natural ingredients.

NF-8449/ND,Ginseng Flavor Extract Without Diacetyl,"<p>Nature's Flavours Ginseng Flavor Extract is a water soluble, clear, liquid flavoring. This Flavor Extract is excellent for baking, ice cream, coffee syrups and in beverage applications! Nature's Flavours Ginseng Flavor Extract is Kosher, Vegan, and Gluten Free. The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% organic. When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavours carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients through these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employee. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavours allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and Gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavours has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products. We hope they bring you much enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>",01/06/2022,,25.39,Default,Ginseng Flavor Extract Without Diacetyl,Flavor the way nature intended.

NF-9339/ND,Habanero Flavor Extract Without Diacetyl,"<p>Nature's Flavours Habanero Flavor Extract is excellent for baking. This almond flavor is very strong and heat stable. It also works well in ice cream applications. Our Habanero Flavor Extract is prepared with only the finest almonds and is extracted over a seven day period. Starting usages range from 1/2 teaspoon in 1 gallon of ice cream base to 1 ounce for every 10 pounds of almond cookie dough. Making small batches and testing them is the best way to determine the proper usage. Remember to allow for extra flavor when heating this Habanero flavor since the heat tends to reduce the strength of the flavor especially when heated over prolonged periods of time.

NF-9424/NAT,Jalapeno Flavor Extract Without Diacetyl,"<p>Jalapeno Flavor Extract (Kosher, Vegan, Gluten Free) is a water soluble, clear, liquid flavoring. This Flavor Extract is excellent for baking, ice cream, coffee syrups and in beverage applications! The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% organic. When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavours carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients through these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employee. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavours allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and Gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavours has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products. We hope they bring you much enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>",01/06/2022,,25.39,Default,Jalapeno Flavor Extract Without Diacetyl,Flavor the way nature intended.

NF-8470,Merlot Flavor Extract Without Diacetyl,"<p>Nature's Flavours Merlot Flavor Extract is a water soluble, clear, liquid flavoring. This Flavor Extract is excellent for baking, ice cream, coffee syrups and in beverage applications! Nature's Flavours Merlot Flavor Extract is Kosher, Vegan, and Gluten Free. The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% organic. When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavours carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients through these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employee. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavours allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and Gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavours has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products. We hope they bring you much enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>",01/06/2022,,25.39,Default,Merlot Flavor Extract Without Diacetyl,Flavor the way nature intended.

Natural Almond Flavor for coffee beans is water soluble, and will also mix well with vegetable glycerin and ethyl alcohol. This Almond flavor has no Allergens. To add flavor to your coffee beans, tea leaves, and other dried herbs, simply sprinkle one-half teaspoon of Nature's Flavors Organic Coffee and Tea Flavoring System over one pound of roasted coffee, tea, or herbs.

Once you have distributed the flavor over your coffee, we recommend you place these newly flavored beans within a sealable container like a mason jar, old coffee can, or a zip-lock bag. After it has been sealed, shake it vigorously to help even out the flavor. Let the sealed container sit for 24 hours to allow the flavors to permeate the coffee or tea.

Nature's Flavors Blackberry Flavoring System for Coffee & Tea is a unique recipe specially tailored to penetrate coffee beans, tea leaves, and any other dried herbs. Nature's Flavors Flavoring Systems are water soluble, and will also mix well with vegetable glycerin and propylene glycol. All of our Coffee and Tea Flavors are Kosher, Vegan, Gluten-free, and contain no Allergens. To add Flavor to your own Coffee Beans, Tea Leaves, and other dried Herbs, simply take one pound of roasted coffee beans and one-half of a teaspoon of your favorite Nature's Flavors Organic Coffee and Tea Flavoring System and sprinkle it over your beans. For the most even distribution we use a sprayer. Once you have distributed your Flavor over your Coffee, we recommend that you place these newly flavored beans within a seal-able container like a mason jar, old coffee can, or a zip-lock bag, then shake it up to help spread the flavor out, and then let the sealed container sit for 24 hours to allow the flavors to permeate the coffee or tea. Nature's Flavors has recently renamed our Flavor Oils for Coffee and Tea, or Organic Coffee and Tea Flavoring Oils, to Flavoring Systems for Coffee and Tea, or Organic Coffee and Tea Flavoring Systems, due to the fact that the name Flavor Oil was misleading.

Cider Flavoring System for Coffee & Tea is a unique recipe specially tailored to penetrate coffee beans, tea leaves, and any other dried herbs. Natures Flavours Flavoring Systems are water soluble, and will also mix well with vegetable glycerin and propylene glycol. All of our Coffee and Tea Flavors are Kosher, Vegan, Gluten Free, and contain NO Allergens! To add Flavor to your own Coffee Beans, Tea Leaves, and other dried Herbs, simply take one pound of roasted coffee beans and one-half of a teaspoon of your favorite Natures Flavours Organic Coffee and Tea Flavoring System and sprinkle it over your beans. For the most even distribution we use a sprayer, instead of sprinkling. Once you have distributed your Flavor over your Coffee, we recommend that you place these newly flavored beans within a seal-able container like a mason jar, old coffee can, or a zip lock back, then shake it up to help spread the flavor out, and then let the sealed container sit for 24 hours to allow the flavors to permeate the coffee or tea.

The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% . When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Natures Flavours carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients through these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employee. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Natures Flavours allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gum's to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Natures Flavours has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products. We hope they bring you much enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>",01/06/2022,,1124.13,Default,Japanese Plum (Organic) Coffee and Tea Flavoring No Diacetyl,Savor the flavor.

Rum Flavoring System for Coffee & Tea is a unique recipe specially tailored to penetrate coffee beans, tea leaves, and any other dried herbs. Due to its unprecedented design this all natural Rum Flavoring System is perfect to add as a flavoring to e-liquids, and e-juice! Natures Flavours' Flavoring Systems are water soluble, and will mix exceptionally with vegetable glycerin and propylene glycol. All of our Organic Coffee and Tea Flavoring systems are Kosher, Vegan, Gluten Free, and contain NO Allergens! To add Flavor to your own Coffee Beans, Tea Leaves, and other dried Herbs, simply take one pound of roasted coffee beans and one-half of a teaspoon of your favorite Natures Flavours' Organic Coffee and Tea Flavoring System and sprinkle it over your beans. For the most even distribution we use a sprayer, instead of sprinkling. Once you have distributed your Flavor over your Coffee, we recommend that you place these newly flavored beans within a seal-able container like a mason jar, old coffee can, or a zip lock back, then shake it up to help spread the flavor out, and then let the sealed container sit for 24 hours to allow the flavors to permeate the coffee or tea. Natures Flavours has recently renamed our Flavor Oils for Coffee and Tea, or Organic Coffee and Tea Flavoring Oils, to Flavoring Systems for Coffee and Tea, or Organic Coffee and Tea Flavoring Systems, due to the fact that the name Flavor Oil was misleading. Natures Flavours' Organic Coffee and Tea Flavoring Systems are not set in an oil base, and are not oil soluble. They are a direct evolution from our Flavor Extracts. Like our Flavor Extracts there is a small amount of alcohol added to help the flavors permeate the coffee beans and/or tea leaves. It will evaporate out of the beans or herbs usually with in the first 24 hours you will smell a little alcohol when you first open the sealed container, any remaining alcohol will burn off immediately when you brew the coffee or tea. In the case of Vaping these flavors, the alcohol will provide a very light and rich throat hit. These flavors have no nutritional value as used in this application are calorie, carb, and sugar free.

Tamarind Flavoring System for Coffee & Tea is a unique recipe specially tailored to penetrate coffee beans, tea leaves, and any other dried herbs.

To add Flavor to your own Coffee Beans, Tea Leaves, and other dried Herbs, simply take one pound of roasted coffee beans and one-half of a teaspoon of your favorite Natures Flavours' Organic Coffee and Tea Flavoring System and sprinkle it over your beans. For the most even distribution we use a sprayer, instead of sprinkling. Once you have distributed your Flavor over your Coffee, we recommend that you place these newly flavored beans within a seal-able container like a mason jar, old coffee can, or a zip lock back, then shake it up to help spread the flavor out, and then let the sealed container sit for 24 hours to allow the flavors to permeate the coffee or tea.

To add Flavor to your own Coffee Beans, Tea Leaves, and other dried Herbs, simply take one pound of roasted coffee beans and one-half of a teaspoon of your favorite Natures Flavours' Organic Coffee and Tea Flavoring System and sprinkle it over your beans. For the most even distribution we use a sprayer, instead of sprinkling. Once you have distributed your Flavor over your Coffee, we recommend that you place these newly flavored beans within a seal-able container like a mason jar, old coffee can, or a zip lock back, then shake it up to help spread the flavor out, and then let the sealed container sit for 24 hours to allow the flavors to permeate the coffee or tea. Natures Flavours has recently renamed our Flavor Oils for Coffee and Tea, or Organic Coffee and Tea Flavoring Oils, to Flavoring Systems for Coffee and Tea, or Organic Coffee and Tea Flavoring Systems, due to the fact that the name Flavor Oil was misleading. Natures Flavours' Organic Coffee and Tea Flavoring Systems are not set in an oil base, and are not oil soluble. They are a direct evolution from our Flavor Extracts. Like our Flavor Extracts there is a small amount of alcohol added to help the flavors permeate the coffee beans and/or tea leaves. It will evaporate out of the beans or herbs usually with in the first 24 hours you will smell a little alcohol when you first open the sealed container, any remaining alcohol will burn off immediately when you brew the coffee or tea. In the case of Vaping these flavors, the alcohol will provide a very light and rich throat hit. These flavors have no nutritional value as used in this application are calorie, carb, and sugar free. There is no fat. Enjoy.

NF-5775/ORG/ND2,,"<p>Organic Almond Cream Flavor Concentrate is Kosher, Gluten free, Vegan, Organic, Alcohol free, excellent for baking, dairy, beverage, and pies. <br /> Nature's Flavors Organic almond cream flavor concentrate is 100% organic. The essential oils are emulsified and stabilized into a water soluble form. Nature's Flavors organic almond cream flavor can be used in many recipes. This organic almond cream flavor can be used in baking since the almond cream is heat stable up to 375 degrees and up to one hour. This organic almond cream flavor will work well in dairy applications such as ice cream and yogurt as well as milk shakes and protein drinks. In addition, the organic almond cream flavor will be excellent for pies, cakes, cookies and other sweet desserts. Nature's Flavors organic almond cream flavor concentrate is very strong and a little goes a long way. Care should be taken to not use too much or over flavor a product. If you taste the flavor longer than 3 to 5 seconds on your palate or if you are tasting a metallic or taste, then you have over flavored the product, which will cause you to burp almond cola for an hour following ingestion. Remember, more is not always better. Use just enough to tease the taste buds, but dont try to satisfy yourself or your customer with a lot of flavor. Over flavoring usually means you will become tired of the flavor quickly and never use it again. Blending our organic extract or flavor concentrate with the organic almond cola flavor concentrate will smooth out the flavor and enhance it, causing you to use less flavor while smoothing out any rough edges in the taste. extracts act like an enhancer much the same way as cream and sugar are to coffee. <br /><br /></p>",,01/01/2022,39.67,Default,,,137249,http://www.naturesflavors.com/organic-flavors/137249-organic-almond-cream-flavor-concentrate-without-diacetyl.html,Nature's Flavors,"Ingredient Statement:Water, Gum Acacia, Organic Sugar, Glycerin, Natural Flavors, and Citric Acid.",PRODUCTS:-1>Extracts & Flavorings:9>Organic Flavors:62,,"Choose your option:8 oz.,32 oz.,1 gal.,5 gal.,2 oz.",NF-5775/ORG/ND2-8oz|NF-5775/ORG/ND2-32oz|NF-5775/ORG/ND2-1gal|NF-5775/ORG/ND2-5gal|NF-5775/ORG/ND2-2oz,39.67|95.22|134.89|665.35|23.80,1.00|4.50|11.50|51.00|0.45

NF-5775/ND,Almond Cream Flavor Concentrate Without Diacetyl,"<p>Almond Cream Flavor Concentrate is Kosher, Gluten free, Vegan, , Alcohol free, excellent for baking, dairy, beverage, and pies.<br /> Nature's Flavors almond cream flavor concentrate is 100% . The essential oils are emulsified and stabilized into a water soluble form. Nature's Flavors almond cream flavor can be used in many recipes. This almond cream flavor can be used in baking since the almond cream is heat stable up to 375 degrees and up to one hour. This almond cream flavor will work well in dairy applications such as ice cream and yogurt as well as milk shakes and protein drinks. In addition, the almond cream flavor will be excellent for pies, cakes, cookies and other sweet desserts. Nature's Flavors almond cream flavor concentrate is very strong and a little goes a long way. Care should be taken to not use too much or over flavor a product. If you taste the flavor longer than 3 to 5 seconds on your palate or if you are tasting a metallic or taste, then you have over flavored the product, which will cause you to burp almond cola for an hour following ingestion. Remember, more is not always better. Use just enough to tease the taste buds, but dont try to satisfy yourself or your customer with a lot of flavor. Over flavoring usually means you will become tired of the flavor quickly and never use it again. Blending our extract or flavor concentrate with the almond cola flavor concentrate will smooth out the flavor and enhance it, causing you to use less flavor while smoothing out any rough edges in the taste. extracts act like an enhancer much the same way as cream and sugar are to coffee.<br /><br /> Ingredients: Water, Gum Acacia, Flavors.</p>",01/06/2022,,31.74,Default,Almond Cream Flavor Concentrate Without Diacetyl,Almond Cream Flavor Concentrate Without Diacetyl  Natures Flavors  The finest organic and Natural ingredients.

NF-4488/ND,Organic Almond Flavor Concentrate Without Diacetyl,"<p>Nature's Flavors Organic Almond Flavor Concentrate is Kosher, Gluten-free, Vegan, Organic, Alcohol free. It is excellent for baking, dairy, beverage, pies and candy applications. Originating in the Middle East and South East Asia, the almond was transported throughout the world in ancient times and continues to be greatly produced. The United States is the largest almond producer in the world. Nature's Flavors Almond Flavor Concentrate can be used in baking since the almond is heat stable up to 375 degrees for up to one hour. This organic Almond Flavor Concentrate works well in dairy applications such as ice cream and yogurt, milk and milk shakes, and protein drinks. Nature's Flavors organic allspice flavor concentrate is very strong-- a little goes a long way. Care should be taken to not use too much or over-flavor a product. If you taste the flavor longer than 3 to 5 seconds on your palate, or if you experience a metallic or taste, then you have over-flavored the product, meaning you will be burping allspice for up to an hour after consumption. Nature's Flavors Organic Almond Favor provides additional uses as a flavoring for pies, cakes, pastries and cookies, and can be used as a low quantity replacer of almond paste. Remember, more is not always better. Use just enough to tease the taste buds and avoid overwhelming yourself or your customer with too much flavor. Over-flavoring usually means you will become tired of the flavor quickly and probably never use it again. Blending our Organic Vanilla Extract or Vanilla Flavor Concentrate with the Organic Almond Flavor Concentrate will smooth out the flavor, and enhance it so you will need less flavor to smooth out any rough edges in the taste. Vanilla extracts act like an enhancer much the same way as cream and sugar are to coffee.
