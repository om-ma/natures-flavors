During the course of ageing, the extract is continually sampled for peak flavor. We only pull the extract off extraction when it reaches our high standards for taste. The final test prior to filtering is to run the sample on a gas chromatograph which checks for peak purity. You may view our chromatographs and mass spectrometers on our quality control page. Once this testing is complete, the extract is sent to the filtering room where the ground up bean is separated from the liquid extract. The finished vanilla extract may be bottled at this time or put in drums for more ageing.<br/><br/> Good vanilla extract is never rushed but is allowed to age like a fine wine until its time has come. We treat our vanillas this way every time. Our customers have won many awards and honors with our vanilla extract being part of their recipes.

Did you ever wonder how the pastries at your favorite bakery or store have that shiny sheen to them? This sheen, unless baked on using eggs, is usually achieved by spraying or brushing on a proprietary blend of sugars, fruit purees and natural stabilizers. Nature's Flavors' Organic Fruit Glazes are applied after baking rather than before (unlike egg mixtures which have to be baked on). Spray or brush the glaze on freshly baked pastries to add that special shine just like your favorite bakery does. You can also spray your favorite glaze on ribs just after barbecuing to give them an attractive sheen and a sweeter taste. The glazes dry very quickly and have a slight flavor. However, if you prefer, you can order the Nature's Flavors' Organic Glaze without any added flavor.</p>",01/06/2022,,33.06,Default,Organic Strawberry Glaze,"Organic Strawberry Glaze (Kosher, Vegan, Gluten-Free)  Natures Flavors  The finest organic and Natural ingredients.

NF-8279/ORG,"Acai Compound, Organic","<p>The processes for making organic flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are organic rather than just natural. You start by using only certified organic ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% organic. When calling it 100% organic you must use only certified organic ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified organic flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% organic flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own organic ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of organic and natural flavors are filtered RO water and organic alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employee. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take organic vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an organic alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard organic vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its organic vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the organic flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based organic flavor concentrate. To make the organic flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an organic gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest organic flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these organic products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our organic products.

When calling it 100% organic you must use only certified organic ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified organic flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% organic flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own organic ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of organic and natural flavors are filtered RO water and organic alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employee. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take organic vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an organic alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard organic vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its organic vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the organic flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based organic flavor concentrate. To make the organic flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an organic gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest organic flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts.

NF-6085/ORG,"Pecan Compound, Organic","<p>The processes for making organic flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are organic rather than just natural. You start by using only certified organic ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% organic. When calling it 100% organic you must use only certified organic ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified organic flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% organic flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own organic ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technologies to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of organic and natural flavors are filtered RO water and organic alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employ. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take organic vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an organic alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard organic vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its organic vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well.

NF-4819/ORG,Organic Caramel Apple Dip,"<p>This organic caramel topping tastes like it contains dairy, but is made using a unique blend of all organic ingredients that fools even the most experienced chef. Our organic non-dairy caramel topping is excellent over soy-based ice cream, blended in non-dairy coffee drinks and smoothies, or drizzled over cheesecake.&nbsp;The enjoyment possibilities for this topping are endless. And good news for weight watchers, Nature's Flavors Organic&nbsp;Caramel Dip for Apples is also fat free. As the product name suggests, this organic syrup is perfect for making caramel dipped apples, and great for baking because it is very heat stable. For a true taste treat, here are a couple of suggestions when preparing to enjoy our organic caramel dip on a juicy apple. Heat the caramel topping in a warm water bath up to about 90 degrees. This will make it easier to submerge the apple in the caramel. (The visualization is almost as good as the actual eating!) Chilling the apple before dipping will allow the warm caramel to stick quicker. You're now ready to indulge yourself with another healthy tasty treat from Nature's Flavors. Enjoy!

NF-OSMO,Organic Sesame Oil,"<p>Our sesame oil is pressed from nutrient-dense sesame seeds, which are exceptionally rich in iron, magnesium, copper, calcium, manganese, and vitamins B and E. With all these benefits packed into a convenient bottle, it is no wonder that sesame oil is one of the earliest known crop-based oil, retaining its extreme popularity for hundreds of years in all parts of Asia. Sesame is native to sub-Saharan Africa, being heavily cultivated during the Indus valley civilization. The benefits of consuming sesame oil are well-known in many Asian cultures-for instance, did you know that In Tamil literature and medicine, sesame oil has been mentioned as the ""very good and healthy oil"", whereas in the Far East, sesame oil is heavily used to prepare meals for women during postpartum confinement. At Nature's Flavors, we are very happy that this wonderful sesame oil is now available in America. Much research has been done on sesame oil, showing that it possesses antibacterial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. There is a study that indicates that sesame oil may play a role in inhibiting the growth of malignant melanomas, and taken regularly, may help in maintaining the balance between good cholesterol (HDL) and bad cholesterol (LDL). This could be attributed to the high prevalence of phytosterols (sterols naturally found in plants) in sesame oil. There is even an experiment done where students who rinsed their mouths with sesame oil showed an 85% reduction in the bacteria that causes gingivitis. Women of ancient Babylon would eat halva, a mixture of sesame oil, honey and sesame seeds to prolong youth and beauty, while Roman soldiers ate the same thing, believing it gave them strength and energy. Indians believe that sesame oil restores moisture to the skin, keeping it soft, flexible and young looking. No description of sesame oil would be complete without mention of sesamin, which is a lignan named after the sesame plant. Sesamin has been used as a dietary fat-reduction supplement and contains significant antioxidant and anticancer properties. Sesamin combined with poly-unsaturated fats found in sesame oil make it potentially very effective for controlling blood pressure and cholesterol levels. So what are you waiting for? Go ahead and try our Nature's Flavors Sesame Oil right now, for you will NOT regret it!!</p>",01/06/2022,,14.55,Default,Organic Sesame Oil,Organic Sesame Oil  Natures Flavors  The finest organic and Natural ingredients.

NF-EYP,Dried Egg Yolk Powder,"<p>By using powdered egg yolks, there is no mess in separating the whites from the yolks and they require no refrigeration. The shelf life of dried egg yolks is about one year with no refrigeration required.</p>
<p>When storing powdered egg yolks keep them in air-tight resealable containers away from heat or large temperature swings. It is also important to keep dried egg products away from direct sunlight or artificial light as that will cause the eggs to oxidize quickly. This is because of their high-fat content.</p>
<p>Nature's Flavors dried powdered egg yolks are excellent for cooking, Baking, and adding fats to foods where fat is necessary to achieve a smooth textured product.</p>
<p>An example would be in making sauces such as hollandaise, or making a powdered custard mix, or a powdered ice cream mix like gelato where additional fat is a must. They create a smooth texture and good mouth feel by controlling the crystallization of the water molecules. The dried egg yolks are pasteurized so they are very stable for long periods of time.</p>
<p>When storing dried powdered egg yolks or egg whites you should keep them in air-tight resalable containers away from heat or large temperature swings. It is also important to keep dried egg products away from direct sunlight or artificial light as that will cause the eggs to oxidize quickly.</p>
<p>This is especially true for dried egg yolks due to their high-fat content. Using powdered egg yolks or egg whites in cooking applications produces good clean results consistently time after time that's why manufacturers overwhelmingly approve of dried egg products over the alternative of having to crack and separate the egg yolks from the egg whites. Also, you don't have to worry about potential bacterial contamination as once they are pasteurized and kept dry until used they are usually free of this problem. Once you hydrate them than they must be used right away. Shelf life of dried egg yolks is about one year or more with no refrigeration required. Dried egg yolks are an excellent emulsifier especially in the formation of mayonnaise, or salad dressings or any food where water and oil will need to be mixed together.</p>
<p>Using powdered eggs yolks in cooking applications produces good clean results consistently time after time which is why manufacturers overwhelmingly approve of dried egg products over the alternative of having to crack and separate the egg yolks from the egg whites.</p>
<p>If you need to add a bit of fat to foods to achieve a smooth textured product, egg yolk powder will do that for you. Examples of this would be in making Hollandaise sauce, or when making gelato where additional fat is a must. They create a smooth texture and good-mouth feel by controlling the crystallization of the water molecules.</p>
<p><strong>How to use the powdered egg yolk &ndash; here's the conversion:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3 teaspoons equals 1 tablespoon</li>
<li>One medium egg contains about 3 teaspoons of egg yolk in it. (One teaspoon of dried egg yolk power plus 2 ? teaspoons of water will give you 3 ? teaspoons of egg yolk, just about the yolk of one medium size egg yolk.)</li>
<li>One large egg contains about 4 teaspoons of egg yolk in it.</li>
<li>An extra-large egg contains about 4 ? or more teaspoons of egg yolk in it, depending on the exact size of the egg.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recipes</strong><br /> Dried powdered egg yolks are an excellent emulsifier to use in salad dressings, homemade mayonnaise, an egg glaze for pie crust, egg drop soup, Hollandaise sauce, crepes and in any food where water and oil will need to be mixed together. These powdered egg yolks also make a nice hair conditioner (1 yolk) in the final rinse after shampooing, leave in a minute or two and rinse thoroughly, and in a facial mask (1-2 yolks), leave on your face up to 5 minutes and rinse. It will tighten your pores and give you an instant face ""lift.""</p>

NF-4889/ORG,"Black Cherry Syrup, Organic","<p>This syrup can be used in so many ways. One of its most popular uses is in coffee as a flavor and sweetener. In an 8-ounce cup of coffee, add 1 to 2 teaspoons of syrup (depending on your sweetness preference).<br /><br />If you have a way to make homemade ice cream, then it will make the greatest black cherry-flavored ice cream you have ever tasted. Simply add one tablespoon syrup to 16 ounces of half-and-half and mix thoroughly. Then add 1 cup of organic corn syrup or honey. Finally, add 1 teaspoon of Nature&rsquo;s Flavors&rsquo; Organic Vanilla Extract, mix and allow it to chill for 1 to 2 hours. Once chilled, you can begin adding the mixture to your automatic ice cream maker. This recipe works great in most automatic ice cream makers like the Cuisinart&trade; frozen yogurt, ice cream, and sorbet maker.<br /><br />It's&nbsp;also excellent for baking. It is very heat stable and will bake well without a significant flavor loss. It is excellent in cookies, cakes, and icings. You can add a little to puddings and custards for a little extra flair.</p>",01/06/2022,,15.53,Default,Organic Black Cherry Syrup,Enjoy the amazing flavor of our finely crafted Organic Black Cherry Syrup the way mother nature intended.
