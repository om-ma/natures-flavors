NF-8489N,Erythritol Sweetened Orange Mango Flavored Powder Drink Mix,"<p>Erythritol sweetened Orange Mango Flavored powder drink mix. 0 Glycemic Index, Kosher, Gluten Free, Vegan, Excellent beverage for low carb diet.
<br><br>
Erythritol sweetened Orange Mango Flavored powder drink mix is super-easy to make: just dissolve it in a bit of still or sparkling water (proportions varying according to taste; add more if you like it sweeter and less for a flavoured water- like mix). To make it even better, you can add fresh orange wedges, as well as lemon or lime juice. You can also add it to various fruit concoctions, shakes and smoothies; we like it with freshly pressed raspberry juice, lemon wedges, and some soda just for the spark. Erythritol sweetened Orange Mango Flavored powder drink mix tastes particularly refreshing, which makes it ideal for summery drinks- you can use it to sweeten and add a fruity flavour to iced teas, lemonades; or you could simply mix Erythritol sweetened Orange Mango Flavored powder drink mix with still water and freeze it to make slushies. If desired you can even add a dash of <a href=""https://www.naturesflavors.com/organic-snow-cone-syrup/64467-pomegranate-snow-cone-syrup-organic.html"" >Organic Pomegranate Snow Cone Syrup (Vegan, Kosher, Gluten-Free)</a>, to make it taste even more delicious.
<br><br>
<strong>Benefits:</strong> We all love a good refreshing glass of fruity soda or lemonade; but the trouble is- many of the products you can find in stores are packed with plenty of sugar; which makes your daily calorie intake sky-rocket through the roof and damages your teeth; not to mention all the artificial colourings and flavourings they contain. Unlike any of these, Erythritol sweetened Orange Mango Flavored powder drink mix is prepared with natural flavourings only and sweetened with erythritol- a natural sweetener which has only 5% of sugar's calories and a glycaemic index of practically 0; which makes it perfect for low carb dieat.

First, although chlorophyll is the only pure, natural green color ingredient, the FDA has not yet approved its use as a color additive. Second, even if the FDA gave the go-ahead to sell it, it would not be an effective natural color to use because the color molecules are very fragile and break down extremely easily and quickly.

NF-8470/NAT,"Merlot Flavor Extract, Natural","<p>Nature's Flavors Merlot Flavor Extract is a water soluble, clear, liquid flavoring. This Flavor Extract is excellent for baking, ice cream, coffee syrups and in beverage applications! Nature's Flavors Merlot Flavor Extract is Kosher, Vegan, and Gluten Free. The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% organic. When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients through these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employee. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and Gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products. We hope they bring you much enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>",01/06/2022,,21.16,Default,Merlot Flavor Extract,Flavor the way nature intended.

NF-6118/ORG/O,"Pine Fragrance Oil (Oil Soluble), Organic","<p>Nature's Flavors Oil Soluble Fragrance Oils should NOT be used in any water based applications. For water based applications look for water soluble fragrance oils or emulsions like these. Starting usage levels range from about one to five percent. With cosmetics be sure and test the products in the soft skin portion of your arm around the elbow area to check for sensitivity if there are any signs of rash or itching than discontinue using these scents. When scenting candles, melt, and pour soaps, start with a a small amount as these oils are strong you can always add more. When making glycerin based soaps you should use the regular fragrance oils found in the aromatherapy section as these are more soluble in that application. You can use these oils to scent kerosene lanterns but use small amounts about 1 tsp per 8 ounces of kerosene. In massage oils use 2 two 3 drops per 8 ounces to start and work up from there to get to the desired level. We recommend you not use cinnamon or cherry on any application that touches human skin as irritation may occur. Nature's Flavors has created one of the largest collections of Oil Soluble Fragrances in the world. This vast selection of Fragrances is available for everyone from individuals, to fellow manufacturers. Since we make these fragrances right here in Orange, California, we can offer these superior fragrance oils at very competitive prices. We search the world over for the finest and most unusual ingredients to make these delicate scents. Many of these natural scents are formulated with essential oils and true flower essences such as gardenia, jasmine, and roses. As we continue to build Natures Fragrances, we will always keep an ear out for suggestions from our customers to help deliver the most diverse selection! We have been making Powdered, and Liquid - Water Soluble, and Liquid - Oil Soluble Fragrances for over twenty five years. Nature's Flavors Fragrances are heat stable and highly concentrated so a little goes a long way. Fragrance Oils are best used in applications where an oil soluble liquid fragrance is desired. For Water Based applications we recommend using our Water Soluble Fragrance Oils, instead of this Oil Soluble Fragrance. If you don't see a fragrance or flavor that you need you can request it. We continue to research and add fragrances and flavors based on your requests, so keep them coming!

Lots of things can be created with this great taste. Acorn Flavor Concentrate might not be your first thought for ice cream, baked goods, or shakes, but you'll be surprised once you try it.

NF-8366,"Alfredo Flavor Concentrate, Natural","<p>Ever run into times where only a big bowl of satisfying noodles will do? We love everything about alfredo pasta from its creaminess, to the richness of the sauce, to the great taste of parmesan. The Italians had it right when they came up with this great sauce. In fact, did you know that the original version of alfredo sauce only included parmesan and butter atop fettuccini noodles? Alfredo di Lelio of Italy created this sauce one evening for his pregnant wife. After seeing the success of the way the sauce was revered, he decided to open a restaurant in Italy, and later another in New York. The original name for this creation is pasta al burro, meaning pasta with butter. The traditional version did not contain cream, as that is something Americans have incorporated throughout the years. The dish's name eventually evolved to alfredo with di Lelio as its namesake. Nature's Flavours Alfredo Flavor Concentrate contains a rich and creamy alfredo flavor.

This flavor is moderately heat stable. It brings out a well rounded flavor in these applications. Starting usages should be 1 to 5% depending on how long you cook and how high the temp but you may use even less flavor in some applications due to the nature of the flavor and the make up of the formula ingredients you are using. It is not uncommon to see usages of less than 1% and .1% could be your finished usage. You will have to experiment with each flavor as they can all vary.

NF-10907,Acai Coffee and Tea Flavoring,"<p>The acai berry can be found in the Amazonian forests of South America. Acai&rsquo;s flavor component can be described as a rich berry with chocolate undertones. Much like chocolate, the acai berry contains the chemical compound polyphenols, giving acai that similar bitter taste. Polyphenols are also found in coffees, making our Acai Coffee and Tea Flavoring a fun pair to your coffee. To add Flavor to your own Coffee Beans, Tea Leaves, and other dried Herbs, simply take one pound of roasted coffee beans and half a teaspoon of your favorite Nature's Flavors' Acai Coffee and Tea Flavoring and sprinkle it over your beans. Once you have distributed the Flavor to your liking, we recommend placing the beans in a seal-able container or bag, give it a few good shakes, and let the sealed container or bag sit for 24 hours to allow the flavors to permeate the coffee or tea. When opening up your flavored beans the next day, you will instantly smell the berry aroma. They are ready to be grinded and enjoyed as a unique flavor of coffee. Our flavorings are calorie, carb, and sugar free and do not contain fat.</p>",01/06/2022,,13.22,Default,Acai Coffee and Tea Flavoring,Flavor the way nature intended.
