NF-6372/NAT,Espresso Flavor Oil for Chocolate,"<p>Nature's Flavors' Espresso Flavor Oil for Chocolate is specially formulated for use in oil soluble chocolate applications. This flavor works well when added to pure chocolate or cocoa bases. It will not separate as long as the application is in an oil soluble form. This flavor oil works very well for the chocolatier who is trying to add flavor to a chocolate coating. It will work with dark, milk or white chocolate coatings. For best distribution of flavor, it's recommended that a small amount of flavor oil for chocolate be added to a small amount of 76 degree coconut oil. A good starting usage for all of Nature's Flavors' flavor oils is approximately one quarter teaspoon of flavor per one pound of chocolate. If the flavor seems too strong, cut your usage in half. Typically, you should not be able to taste the flavor three to five seconds after you have swallowed the chocolate. It should have a clean feeling and should go away quickly, leaving you with the desire to have more. This is a difficult result to achieve since most connoisseurs, chefs and cooks having fun in their kitchen, tend to overdo it by adding more flavor than needed. In this case, the effect is that you won't want more even though you don't necessarily identify anything being wrong with the chocolate. Chocolate is a very intense flavor by itself so adding flavor to it and getting the right effect is difficult and takes practice. It is fun to experiment with the chocolate; achieving the perfect flavor profile can be very rewarding. Nature's Flavors' Flavor Oil for Chocolate is true to its name having a very sweet but delicate note. It bakes well in chocolate and also does very well in cookies, cakes and bread. It is very stable for weeks at room temperature and freezes well. All of the flavor oils work well in icings and oil based coatings. This flavor oil for chocolate can also be added to sauces and dressings and can be emulsified to become water soluble. Due to its very low usage level, there is little or no nutritional value. The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employ. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products. We hope they bring you much enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>",01/06/2022,,26.19,,Default,Espresso Flavor Oil for Chocolate,Flavor the way nature intended.

Typically, you should not be able to taste the flavor three to five seconds after you have swallowed the chocolate. It should have a clean feeling and should go away quickly, leaving you with the desire to have more. This is a difficult result to achieve since most connoisseurs, chefs and cooks having fun in their kitchen, tend to overdo it by adding more flavor than needed. In this case, the effect is that you won't want more even though you don't necessarily identify anything being wrong with the chocolate. Chocolate is a very intense flavor by itself so adding flavor to it and getting the right effect is difficult and takes practice. It is fun to experiment with the chocolate; achieving the perfect flavor profile can be very rewarding. Nature's Flavors' Flavor Oil for Chocolate is true to its name having a very sweet but delicate note. It bakes well in chocolate and also does very well in cookies, cakes and bread. It is very stable for weeks at room temperature and freezes well. All of the flavor oils work well in icings and oil based coatings. This flavor oil for chocolate can also be added to sauces and dressings and can be emulsified to become water soluble. Due to its very low usage level, there is little or no nutritional value. The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employ. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products.

NF-2403/NAT/C,Bavarian Cream Flavor Oil for Chocolate,"<p>Nature's Flavors' Bavarian Cream Flavor Oil for Chocolate is specially formulated for use in oil soluble chocolate applications. This flavor works well when added to pure chocolate or cocoa bases. It will not separate as long as the application is in an oil soluble form. This flavor oil works very well for the chocolatier who is trying to add flavor to a chocolate coating. It will work with dark, milk or white chocolate coatings. For best distribution of flavor, it's recommended that a small amount of flavor oil for chocolate be added to a small amount of 76 degree coconut oil. A good starting usage for all of Nature's Flavors' flavor oils is approximately one quarter teaspoon of flavor per one pound of chocolate. If the flavor seems too strong, cut your usage in half. Typically, you should not be able to taste the flavor three to five seconds after you have swallowed the chocolate. It should have a clean feeling and should go away quickly, leaving you with the desire to have more. This is a difficult result to achieve since most connoisseurs, chefs and cooks having fun in their kitchen, tend to overdo it by adding more flavor than needed. In this case, the effect is that you won't want more even though you don't necessarily identify anything being wrong with the chocolate. Chocolate is a very intense flavor by itself so adding flavor to it and getting the right effect is difficult and takes practice. It is fun to experiment with the chocolate; achieving the perfect flavor profile can be very rewarding. Nature's Flavors' Flavor Oil for Chocolate is true to its name having a very sweet but delicate note. It bakes well in chocolate and also does very well in cookies, cakes and bread. It is very stable for weeks at room temperature and freezes well. All of the flavor oils work well in icings and oil based coatings. This flavor oil for chocolate can also be added to sauces and dressings and can be emulsified to become water soluble. Due to its very low usage level, there is little or no nutritional value. The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employ. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products. We hope they bring you much enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>",01/06/2022,,26.19,,Default,Bavarian Cream Flavor Oil for Chocolate,Flavor the way nature intended.

Steam distillation is another method we employ. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts.

NF-3692/NAT/C,Blueberry Cheesecake Flavor Oil for Chocolate,"<p>Nature's Flavors' Blueberry Cheesecake Flavor Oil for Chocolate is specially formulated for use in oil soluble chocolate applications. This flavor works well when added to pure chocolate or cocoa bases. It will not separate as long as the application is in an oil soluble form. This flavor oil works very well for the chocolatier who is trying to add flavor to a chocolate coating. It will work with dark, milk or white chocolate coatings. For best distribution of flavor, it's recommended that a small amount of flavor oil for chocolate be added to a small amount of 76 degree coconut oil. A good starting usage for all of Nature's Flavors' flavor oils is approximately one quarter teaspoon of flavor per one pound of chocolate. If the flavor seems too strong, cut your usage in half. Typically, you should not be able to taste the flavor three to five seconds after you have swallowed the chocolate. It should have a clean feeling and should go away quickly, leaving you with the desire to have more. This is a difficult result to achieve since most connoisseurs, chefs and cooks having fun in their kitchen, tend to overdo it by adding more flavor than needed. In this case, the effect is that you won't want more even though you don't necessarily identify anything being wrong with the chocolate.

Nature's Flavors' Flavor Oil for Chocolate is true to its name having a very sweet but delicate note. It bakes well in chocolate and also does very well in cookies, cakes and bread. It is very stable for weeks at room temperature and freezes well. All of the flavor oils work well in icings and oil based coatings. This flavor oil for chocolate can also be added to sauces and dressings and can be emulsified to become water soluble. Due to its very low usage level, there is little or no nutritional value. The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employ. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products. We hope they bring you much enjoyment and satisfaction.

NF-4627/NAT/C,Butter Flavor Oil for Chocolate,"<p>Nature's Flavors' Organic&nbsp;Butter Flavor Oil for Chocolate is specially formulated for use in oil soluble chocolate applications. This flavor works well when added to pure chocolate or cocoa bases. It will not separate as long as the application is in an oil soluble form. This flavor oil works very well for the chocolatier who is trying to add flavor to a chocolate coating. It will work with dark, milk or white chocolate coatings. For best distribution of flavor, it's recommended that a small amount of flavor oil for chocolate be added to a small amount of 76 degree coconut oil. A good starting usage for all of Nature's Flavors' flavor oils is approximately one quarter teaspoon of flavor per one pound of chocolate. If the flavor seems too strong, cut your usage in half. Typically, you should not be able to taste the flavor three to five seconds after you have swallowed the chocolate. It should have a clean feeling and should go away quickly, leaving you with the desire to have more.

NF-3953/NAT/C,Cantaloupe Flavor Oil for Chocolate,"<p>Nature's Flavors' Cantaloupe Flavor Oil for Chocolate is specially formulated for use in oil soluble chocolate applications. This flavor works well when added to pure chocolate or cocoa bases. It will not separate as long as the application is in an oil soluble form. This flavor oil works very well for the chocolatier who is trying to add flavor to a chocolate coating. It will work with dark, milk or white chocolate coatings. For best distribution of flavor, it's recommended that a small amount of flavor oil for chocolate be added to a small amount of 76 degree coconut oil. A good starting usage for all of Nature's Flavors' flavor oils is approximately one quarter teaspoon of flavor per one pound of chocolate. If the flavor seems too strong, cut your usage in half. Typically, you should not be able to taste the flavor three to five seconds after you have swallowed the chocolate. It should have a clean feeling and should go away quickly, leaving you with the desire to have more. This is a difficult result to achieve since most connoisseurs, chefs and cooks having fun in their kitchen, tend to overdo it by adding more flavor than needed. In this case, the effect is that you won't want more even though you don't necessarily identify anything being wrong with the chocolate. Chocolate is a very intense flavor by itself so adding flavor to it and getting the right effect is difficult and takes practice. It is fun to experiment with the chocolate; achieving the perfect flavor profile can be very rewarding. Nature's Flavors' Flavor Oil for Chocolate is true to its name having a very sweet but delicate note. It bakes well in chocolate and also does very well in cookies, cakes and bread. It is very stable for weeks at room temperature and freezes well. All of the flavor oils work well in icings and oil based coatings. This flavor oil for chocolate can also be added to sauces and dressings and can be emulsified to become water soluble. Due to its very low usage level, there is little or no nutritional value. The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employ. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products.

Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products.

NF-3671/NAT/O/C,Carrot Cake Flavor Oil for Chocolate,"<p>Nature's Flavors' Carrot Cake Flavor Oil for Chocolate is specially formulated for use in oil soluble chocolate applications. This flavor works well when added to pure chocolate or cocoa bases. It will not separate as long as the application is in an oil soluble form. This flavor oil works very well for the chocolatier who is trying to add flavor to a chocolate coating. It will work with dark, milk or white chocolate coatings. For best distribution of flavor, it's recommended that a small amount of flavor oil for chocolate be added to a small amount of 76 degree coconut oil. A good starting usage for all of Nature's Flavors' flavor oils is approximately one quarter teaspoon of flavor per one pound of chocolate. If the flavor seems too strong, cut your usage in half. Typically, you should not be able to taste the flavor three to five seconds after you have swallowed the chocolate. It should have a clean feeling and should go away quickly, leaving you with the desire to have more. This is a difficult result to achieve since most connoisseurs, chefs and cooks having fun in their kitchen, tend to overdo it by adding more flavor than needed. In this case, the effect is that you won't want more even though you don't necessarily identify anything being wrong with the chocolate. Chocolate is a very intense flavor by itself so adding flavor to it and getting the right effect is difficult and takes practice. It is fun to experiment with the chocolate; achieving the perfect flavor profile can be very rewarding. Nature's Flavors' Flavor Oil for Chocolate is true to its name having a very sweet but delicate note. It bakes well in chocolate and also does very well in cookies, cakes and bread. It is very stable for weeks at room temperature and freezes well. All of the flavor oils work well in icings and oil based coatings. This flavor oil for chocolate can also be added to sauces and dressings and can be emulsified to become water soluble. Due to its very low usage level, there is little or no nutritional value.

This flavor oil for chocolate can also be added to sauces and dressings and can be emulsified to become water soluble. Due to its very low usage level, there is little or no nutritional value. The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employ. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products.

NF-5190/NAT,Chestnut Flavor Oil for Chocolate,"<p>Nature's Flavors' Chestnut Flavor Oil for Chocolate is specially formulated for use in oil soluble chocolate applications. This flavor works well when added to pure chocolate or cocoa bases. It will not separate as long as the application is in an oil soluble form. This flavor oil works very well for the chocolatier who is trying to add flavor to a chocolate coating. It will work with dark, milk or white chocolate coatings. For best distribution of flavor, it's recommended that a small amount of flavor oil for chocolate be added to a small amount of 76 degree coconut oil. A good starting usage for all of Nature's Flavors' flavor oils is approximately one quarter teaspoon of flavor per one pound of chocolate. If the flavor seems too strong, cut your usage in half. Typically, you should not be able to taste the flavor three to five seconds after you have swallowed the chocolate. It should have a clean feeling and should go away quickly, leaving you with the desire to have more. This is a difficult result to achieve since most connoisseurs, chefs and cooks having fun in their kitchen, tend to overdo it by adding more flavor than needed. In this case, the effect is that you won't want more even though you don't necessarily identify anything being wrong with the chocolate. Chocolate is a very intense flavor by itself so adding flavor to it and getting the right effect is difficult and takes practice. It is fun to experiment with the chocolate; achieving the perfect flavor profile can be very rewarding.

This is a difficult result to achieve since most connoisseurs, chefs and cooks having fun in their kitchen, tend to overdo it by adding more flavor than needed. In this case, the effect is that you won't want more even though you don't necessarily identify anything being wrong with the chocolate. Chocolate is a very intense flavor by itself so adding flavor to it and getting the right effect is difficult and takes practice. It is fun to experiment with the chocolate; achieving the perfect flavor profile can be very rewarding. Nature's Flavors' Flavor Oil for Chocolate is true to its name having a very sweet but delicate note. It bakes well in chocolate and also does very well in cookies, cakes and bread. It is very stable for weeks at room temperature and freezes well. All of the flavor oils work well in icings and oil based coatings. This flavor oil for chocolate can also be added to sauces and dressings and can be emulsified to become water soluble. Due to its very low usage level, there is little or no nutritional value. The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employee. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products.

NF-2666/NAT/C,Coconut Flavor Oil for Chocolate,"<p>Nature's Flavors' Coconut Flavor Oil for Chocolate is specially formulated for use in oil soluble chocolate applications. This flavor works well when added to pure chocolate or cocoa bases. It will not separate as long as the application is in an oil soluble form. This flavor oil works very well for the chocolatier who is trying to add flavor to a chocolate coating. It will work with dark, milk or white chocolate coatings. For best distribution of flavor, it's recommended that a small amount of flavor oil for chocolate be added to a small amount of 76 degree coconut oil. A good starting usage for all of Nature's Flavors' flavor oils is approximately one quarter teaspoon of flavor per one pound of chocolate. If the flavor seems too strong, cut your usage in half. Typically, you should not be able to taste the flavor three to five seconds after you have swallowed the chocolate. It should have a clean feeling and should go away quickly, leaving you with the desire to have more. This is a difficult result to achieve since most connoisseurs, chefs and cooks having fun in their kitchen, tend to overdo it by adding more flavor than needed. In this case, the effect is that you won't want more even though you don't necessarily identify anything being wrong with the chocolate. Chocolate is a very intense flavor by itself so adding flavor to it and getting the right effect is difficult and takes practice. It is fun to experiment with the chocolate; achieving the perfect flavor profile can be very rewarding. Nature's Flavors' Flavor Oil for Chocolate is true to its name having a very sweet but delicate note. It bakes well in chocolate and also does very well in cookies, cakes and bread. It is very stable for weeks at room temperature and freezes well. All of the flavor oils work well in icings and oil based coatings. This flavor oil for chocolate can also be added to sauces and dressings and can be emulsified to become water soluble. Due to its very low usage level, there is little or no nutritional value. The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employ. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products.

Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products.

NF-6959/NAT,Danish Pastry Flavor Oil for Chocolate,"<p>Nature's Flavors' Danish Pastry Flavor Oil for Chocolate is specially formulated for use in oil soluble chocolate applications. This flavor works well when added to pure chocolate or cocoa bases. It will not separate as long as the application is in an oil soluble form. This flavor oil works very well for the chocolatier who is trying to add flavor to a chocolate coating. It will work with dark, milk or white chocolate coatings. For best distribution of flavor, it's recommended that a small amount of flavor oil for chocolate be added to a small amount of 76 degree coconut oil. A good starting usage for all of Nature's Flavors' flavor oils is approximately one quarter teaspoon of flavor per one pound of chocolate. If the flavor seems too strong, cut your usage in half. Typically, you should not be able to taste the flavor three to five seconds after you have swallowed the chocolate. It should have a clean feeling and should go away quickly, leaving you with the desire to have more. This is a difficult result to achieve since most connoisseurs, chefs and cooks having fun in their kitchen, tend to overdo it by adding more flavor than needed. In this case, the effect is that you won't want more even though you don't necessarily identify anything being wrong with the chocolate. Chocolate is a very intense flavor by itself so adding flavor to it and getting the right effect is difficult and takes practice. It is fun to experiment with the chocolate; achieving the perfect flavor profile can be very rewarding. Nature's Flavors' Flavor Oil for Chocolate is true to its name having a very sweet but delicate note. It bakes well in chocolate and also does very well in cookies, cakes and bread. It is very stable for weeks at room temperature and freezes well. All of the flavor oils work well in icings and oil based coatings. This flavor oil for chocolate can also be added to sauces and dressings and can be emulsified to become water soluble. Due to its very low usage level, there is little or no nutritional value. The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it.

This flavor oil for chocolate can also be added to sauces and dressings and can be emulsified to become water soluble. Due to its very low usage level, there is little or no nutritional value. The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employ. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products.

NF-6307/NAT,Ginger Ale Flavor Oil for Chocolate,"<p>Nature's Flavors' Ginger Ale Flavor Oil for Chocolate is specially formulated for use in oil soluble chocolate applications. This flavor works well when added to pure chocolate or cocoa bases. It will not separate as long as the application is in an oil soluble form. This flavor oil works very well for the chocolatier who is trying to add flavor to a chocolate coating. It will work with dark, milk or white chocolate coatings. For best distribution of flavor, it's recommended that a small amount of flavor oil for chocolate be added to a small amount of 76 degree coconut oil. A good starting usage for all of Nature's Flavors' flavor oils is approximately one quarter teaspoon of flavor per one pound of chocolate. If the flavor seems too strong, cut your usage in half. Typically, you should not be able to taste the flavor three to five seconds after you have swallowed the chocolate. It should have a clean feeling and should go away quickly, leaving you with the desire to have more. This is a difficult result to achieve since most connoisseurs, chefs and cooks having fun in their kitchen, tend to overdo it by adding more flavor than needed. In this case, the effect is that you won't want more even though you don't necessarily identify anything being wrong with the chocolate. Chocolate is a very intense flavor by itself so adding flavor to it and getting the right effect is difficult and takes practice. It is fun to experiment with the chocolate; achieving the perfect flavor profile can be very rewarding.

NF-3691/NAT/O/C,Grape Flavor Oil for Chocolate,"<p>Nature's Flavors' Grape Flavor Oil for Chocolate is specially formulated for use in oil soluble chocolate applications. This flavor works well when added to pure chocolate or cocoa bases. It will not separate as long as the application is in an oil soluble form. This flavor oil works very well for the chocolatier who is trying to add flavor to a chocolate coating. It will work with dark, milk or white chocolate coatings. For best distribution of flavor, it's recommended that a small amount of flavor oil for chocolate be added to a small amount of 76 degree coconut oil. A good starting usage for all of Nature's Flavors' flavor oils is approximately one quarter teaspoon of flavor per one pound of chocolate. If the flavor seems too strong, cut your usage in half. Typically, you should not be able to taste the flavor three to five seconds after you have swallowed the chocolate. It should have a clean feeling and should go away quickly, leaving you with the desire to have more. This is a difficult result to achieve since most connoisseurs, chefs and cooks having fun in their kitchen, tend to overdo it by adding more flavor than needed. In this case, the effect is that you won't want more even though you don't necessarily identify anything being wrong with the chocolate. Chocolate is a very intense flavor by itself so adding flavor to it and getting the right effect is difficult and takes practice. It is fun to experiment with the chocolate; achieving the perfect flavor profile can be very rewarding. Nature's Flavors' Flavor Oil for Chocolate is true to its name having a very sweet but delicate note. It bakes well in chocolate and also does very well in cookies, cakes and bread. It is very stable for weeks at room temperature and freezes well. All of the flavor oils work well in icings and oil based coatings. This flavor oil for chocolate can also be added to sauces and dressings and can be emulsified to become water soluble. Due to its very low usage level, there is little or no nutritional value. The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employ. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products.

Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products.

NF-3536/NAT/C,Honeydew Melon Flavor Oil for Chocolate,"<p>Nature's Flavors' Honeydew Melon Flavor Oil for Chocolate is specially formulated for use in oil soluble chocolate applications. This flavor works well when added to pure chocolate or cocoa bases. It will not separate as long as the application is in an oil soluble form. This flavor oil works very well for the chocolatier who is trying to add flavor to a chocolate coating. It will work with dark, milk or white chocolate coatings. For best distribution of flavor, it's recommended that a small amount of flavor oil for chocolate be added to a small amount of 76 degree coconut oil. A good starting usage for all of Nature's Flavors' flavor oils is approximately one quarter teaspoon of flavor per one pound of chocolate. If the flavor seems too strong, cut your usage in half. Typically, you should not be able to taste the flavor three to five seconds after you have swallowed the chocolate. It should have a clean feeling and should go away quickly, leaving you with the desire to have more. This is a difficult result to achieve since most connoisseurs, chefs and cooks having fun in their kitchen, tend to overdo it by adding more flavor than needed. In this case, the effect is that you won't want more even though you don't necessarily identify anything being wrong with the chocolate. Chocolate is a very intense flavor by itself so adding flavor to it and getting the right effect is difficult and takes practice. It is fun to experiment with the chocolate; achieving the perfect flavor profile can be very rewarding. Nature's Flavors' Flavor Oil for Chocolate is true to its name having a very sweet but delicate note. It bakes well in chocolate and also does very well in cookies, cakes and bread. It is very stable for weeks at room temperature and freezes well. All of the flavor oils work well in icings and oil based coatings. This flavor oil for chocolate can also be added to sauces and dressings and can be emulsified to become water soluble. Due to its very low usage level, there is little or no nutritional value. The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it.

It is very stable for weeks at room temperature and freezes well. All of the flavor oils work well in icings and oil based coatings. This flavor oil for chocolate can also be added to sauces and dressings and can be emulsified to become water soluble. Due to its very low usage level, there is little or no nutritional value. The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employ. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products.

NF-2817/NAT/C,Lemon Flavor Oil for Chocolate,"<p>Nature's Flavors Lemon Flavor Oil for Chocolate is specially formulated for use in oil soluble chocolate applications. This flavor works well when added to pure chocolate or cocoa bases. It will not separate as long as the application is in an oil soluble form. This flavor oil works very well for the chocolatier who is trying to add flavor to a chocolate coating. It will work with dark, milk or white chocolate coatings.<br /><br /> For best distribution of flavor, it's recommended that a small amount of flavor oil for chocolate be added to a small amount of 76 degree coconut oil.

This flavor oil works very well for the chocolatier who is trying to add flavor to a chocolate coating. It will work with dark, milk or white chocolate coatings. For best distribution of flavor, it's recommended that a small amount of flavor oil for chocolate be added to a small amount of 76 degree coconut oil. A good starting usage for all of Nature's Flavors' flavor oils is approximately one quarter teaspoon of flavor per one pound of chocolate. If the flavor seems too strong, cut your usage in half. Typically, you should not be able to taste the flavor three to five seconds after you have swallowed the chocolate. It should have a clean feeling and should go away quickly, leaving you with the desire to have more. This is a difficult result to achieve since most connoisseurs, chefs and cooks having fun in their kitchen, tend to overdo it by adding more flavor than needed. In this case, the effect is that you won't want more even though you don't necessarily identify anything being wrong with the chocolate. Chocolate is a very intense flavor by itself so adding flavor to it and getting the right effect is difficult and takes practice. It is fun to experiment with the chocolate; achieving the perfect flavor profile can be very rewarding. Nature's Flavors' Flavor Oil for Chocolate is true to its name having a very sweet but delicate note. It bakes well in chocolate and also does very well in cookies, cakes and bread. It is very stable for weeks at room temperature and freezes well. All of the flavor oils work well in icings and oil based coatings. This flavor oil for chocolate can also be added to sauces and dressings and can be emulsified to become water soluble. Due to its very low usage level, there is little or no nutritional value. The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employee. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products.

NF-3646/NAT/O/C,Maraschino Cherry Flavor Oil for Chocolate,"<p>Nature's Flavors' Maraschino Flavor Oil for Chocolate is specially formulated for use in oil soluble chocolate applications. This flavor works well when added to pure chocolate or cocoa bases. It will not separate as long as the application is in an oil soluble form. This flavor oil works very well for the chocolatier who is trying to add flavor to a chocolate coating. It will work with dark, milk or white chocolate coatings. For best distribution of flavor, it's recommended that a small amount of flavor oil for chocolate be added to a small amount of 76 degree coconut oil. A good starting usage for all of Nature's Flavors' flavor oils is approximately one quarter teaspoon of flavor per one pound of chocolate. If the flavor seems too strong, cut your usage in half. Typically, you should not be able to taste the flavor three to five seconds after you have swallowed the chocolate. It should have a clean feeling and should go away quickly, leaving you with the desire to have more. This is a difficult result to achieve since most connoisseurs, chefs and cooks having fun in their kitchen, tend to overdo it by adding more flavor than needed. In this case, the effect is that you won't want more even though you don't necessarily identify anything being wrong with the chocolate. Chocolate is a very intense flavor by itself so adding flavor to it and getting the right effect is difficult and takes practice. It is fun to experiment with the chocolate; achieving the perfect flavor profile can be very rewarding. Nature's Flavors' Flavor Oil for Chocolate is true to its name having a very sweet but delicate note. It bakes well in chocolate and also does very well in cookies, cakes and bread. It is very stable for weeks at room temperature and freezes well. All of the flavor oils work well in icings and oil based coatings. This flavor oil for chocolate can also be added to sauces and dressings and can be emulsified to become water soluble. Due to its very low usage level, there is little or no nutritional value. The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employ. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts.

This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products.

NF-8169/NAT/O,Mulling Spice Flavor Oil for Chocolate,"<p>Nature's Flavors' Mulling Flavor Oil for Chocolate is specially formulated for use in oil soluble chocolate applications. This flavor works well when added to pure chocolate or cocoa bases. It will not separate as long as the application is in an oil soluble form. This flavor oil works very well for the chocolatier who is trying to add flavor to a chocolate coating. It will work with dark, milk or white chocolate coatings. For best distribution of flavor, it's recommended that a small amount of flavor oil for chocolate be added to a small amount of 76 degree coconut oil. A good starting usage for all of Nature's Flavors' flavor oils is approximately one quarter teaspoon of flavor per one pound of chocolate. If the flavor seems too strong, cut your usage in half. Typically, you should not be able to taste the flavor three to five seconds after you have swallowed the chocolate. It should have a clean feeling and should go away quickly, leaving you with the desire to have more. This is a difficult result to achieve since most connoisseurs, chefs and cooks having fun in their kitchen, tend to overdo it by adding more flavor than needed. In this case, the effect is that you won't want more even though you don't necessarily identify anything being wrong with the chocolate. Chocolate is a very intense flavor by itself so adding flavor to it and getting the right effect is difficult and takes practice. It is fun to experiment with the chocolate; achieving the perfect flavor profile can be very rewarding. Nature's Flavors' Flavor Oil for Chocolate is true to its name having a very sweet but delicate note. It bakes well in chocolate and also does very well in cookies, cakes and bread. It is very stable for weeks at room temperature and freezes well. All of the flavor oils work well in icings and oil based coatings. This flavor oil for chocolate can also be added to sauces and dressings and can be emulsified to become water soluble. Due to its very low usage level, there is little or no nutritional value. The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it.

The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employee. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts.

NF-2594/NAT/C,Orange Flavor Oil for Chocolate,"<p>Nature's Flavors' Orange Flavor Oil for Chocolate is specially formulated for use in oil soluble chocolate applications. This flavor works well when added to pure chocolate or cocoa bases. It will not separate as long as the application is in an oil soluble form. This flavor oil works very well for the chocolatier who is trying to add flavor to a chocolate coating. It will work with dark, milk or white chocolate coatings. For best distribution of flavor, it's recommended that a small amount of flavor oil for chocolate be added to a small amount of 76 degree coconut oil. A good starting usage for all of Nature's Flavors' flavor oils is approximately one quarter teaspoon of flavor per one pound of chocolate. If the flavor seems too strong, cut your usage in half. Typically, you should not be able to taste the flavor three to five seconds after you have swallowed the chocolate. It should have a clean feeling and should go away quickly, leaving you with the desire to have more. This is a difficult result to achieve since most connoisseurs, chefs and cooks having fun in their kitchen, tend to overdo it by adding more flavor than needed. In this case, the effect is that you won't want more even though you don't necessarily identify anything being wrong with the chocolate. Chocolate is a very intense flavor by itself so adding flavor to it and getting the right effect is difficult and takes practice. It is fun to experiment with the chocolate; achieving the perfect flavor profile can be very rewarding.

A good starting usage for all of Nature's Flavors' flavor oils is approximately one quarter teaspoon of flavor per one pound of chocolate. If the flavor seems too strong, cut your usage in half. Typically, you should not be able to taste the flavor three to five seconds after you have swallowed the chocolate. It should have a clean feeling and should go away quickly, leaving you with the desire to have more. This is a difficult result to achieve since most connoisseurs, chefs and cooks having fun in their kitchen, tend to overdo it by adding more flavor than needed. In this case, the effect is that you won't want more even though you don't necessarily identify anything being wrong with the chocolate. Chocolate is a very intense flavor by itself so adding flavor to it and getting the right effect is difficult and takes practice. It is fun to experiment with the chocolate; achieving the perfect flavor profile can be very rewarding. Nature's Flavors' Flavor Oil for Chocolate is true to its name having a very sweet but delicate note. It bakes well in chocolate and also does very well in cookies, cakes and bread. It is very stable for weeks at room temperature and freezes well. All of the flavor oils work well in icings and oil based coatings. This flavor oil for chocolate can also be added to sauces and dressings and can be emulsified to become water soluble. Due to its very low usage level, there is little or no nutritional value. The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employ. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products.

NF-2638/NAT/O,Pineapple Flavor Oil for Chocolate,"<p>Nature's Flavors' Pineapple Flavor Oil for Chocolate is specially formulated for use in oil soluble chocolate applications. This flavor works well when added to pure chocolate or cocoa bases. It will not separate as long as the application is in an oil soluble form. This flavor oil works very well for the chocolatier who is trying to add flavor to a chocolate coating. It will work with dark, milk or white chocolate coatings. For best distribution of flavor, it's recommended that a small amount of flavor oil for chocolate be added to a small amount of 76 degree coconut oil. A good starting usage for all of Nature's Flavors' flavor oils is approximately one quarter teaspoon of flavor per one pound of chocolate. If the flavor seems too strong, cut your usage in half. Typically, you should not be able to taste the flavor three to five seconds after you have swallowed the chocolate. It should have a clean feeling and should go away quickly, leaving you with the desire to have more. This is a difficult result to achieve since most connoisseurs, chefs and cooks having fun in their kitchen, tend to overdo it by adding more flavor than needed. In this case, the effect is that you won't want more even though you don't necessarily identify anything being wrong with the chocolate. Chocolate is a very intense flavor by itself so adding flavor to it and getting the right effect is difficult and takes practice. It is fun to experiment with the chocolate; achieving the perfect flavor profile can be very rewarding. Nature's Flavors' Flavor Oil for Chocolate is true to its name having a very sweet but delicate note. It bakes well in chocolate and also does very well in cookies, cakes and bread. It is very stable for weeks at room temperature and freezes well. All of the flavor oils work well in icings and oil based coatings. This flavor oil for chocolate can also be added to sauces and dressings and can be emulsified to become water soluble. Due to its very low usage level, there is little or no nutritional value. The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employ. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products.

This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products.

NF-3426/NAT,Praline Flavor Oil for Chocolate,"<p>Nature's Flavors' Praline Flavor Oil for Chocolate is specially formulated for use in oil soluble chocolate applications. This flavor works well when added to pure chocolate or cocoa bases. It will not separate as long as the application is in an oil soluble form. This flavor oil works very well for the chocolatier who is trying to add flavor to a chocolate coating. It will work with dark, milk or white chocolate coatings. For best distribution of flavor, it's recommended that a small amount of flavor oil for chocolate be added to a small amount of 76 degree coconut oil. A good starting usage for all of Nature's Flavors' flavor oils is approximately one quarter teaspoon of flavor per one pound of chocolate. If the flavor seems too strong, cut your usage in half. Typically, you should not be able to taste the flavor three to five seconds after you have swallowed the chocolate. It should have a clean feeling and should go away quickly, leaving you with the desire to have more. This is a difficult result to achieve since most connoisseurs, chefs and cooks having fun in their kitchen, tend to overdo it by adding more flavor than needed. In this case, the effect is that you won't want more even though you don't necessarily identify anything being wrong with the chocolate. Chocolate is a very intense flavor by itself so adding flavor to it and getting the right effect is difficult and takes practice. It is fun to experiment with the chocolate; achieving the perfect flavor profile can be very rewarding. Nature's Flavors' Flavor Oil for Chocolate is true to its name having a very sweet but delicate note. It bakes well in chocolate and also does very well in cookies, cakes and bread. It is very stable for weeks at room temperature and freezes well. All of the flavor oils work well in icings and oil based coatings. This flavor oil for chocolate can also be added to sauces and dressings and can be emulsified to become water soluble. Due to its very low usage level, there is little or no nutritional value. The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it.

You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employee. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products.

NF-3482/NAT,Root Beer Flavor Oil for Chocolate,"<p>Nature's Flavors' Root Beer Flavor Oil for Chocolate will not separate as long as the application is in an oil soluble form. It will work with dark, milk or white chocolate coatings. For best distribution of flavor, it's recommended that a small amount of flavor oil for chocolate be added to a small amount of 76 degree coconut oil. A good starting usage for all of Nature's Flavors' flavor oils is approximately one quarter teaspoon of flavor per one pound of chocolate. If the flavor seems too strong, cut your usage in half. Typically, you should not be able to taste the flavor three to five seconds after you have swallowed the chocolate. It should have a clean feeling and should go away quickly, leaving you with the desire to have more. This is a difficult result to achieve since most connoisseurs, chefs and cooks having fun in their kitchen, tend to overdo it by adding more flavor than needed. In this case, the effect is that you won't want more even though you don't necessarily identify anything being wrong with the chocolate. Chocolate is a very intense flavor by itself so adding flavor to it and getting the right effect is difficult and takes practice. It is fun to experiment with the chocolate; achieving the perfect flavor profile can be very rewarding.

In this case, the effect is that you won't want more even though you don't necessarily identify anything being wrong with the chocolate. Chocolate is a very intense flavor by itself so adding flavor to it and getting the right effect is difficult and takes practice. It is fun to experiment with the chocolate; achieving the perfect flavor profile can be very rewarding. Nature's Flavors' Flavor Oil for Chocolate is true to its name having a very sweet but delicate note. It bakes well in chocolate and also does very well in cookies, cakes and bread. It is very stable for weeks at room temperature and freezes well. All of the flavor oils work well in icings and oil based coatings. This flavor oil for chocolate can also be added to sauces and dressings and can be emulsified to become water soluble. Due to its very low usage level, there is little or no nutritional value. The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employ. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts.

NF-5419/NAT/C,Tamarindo Flavor Oil for Chocolate,"<p>Nature's Flavors' Tamarindo Flavor Oil for Chocolate is specially formulated for use in oil soluble chocolate applications. This flavor works well when added to pure chocolate or cocoa bases. It will not separate as long as the application is in an oil soluble form. This flavor oil works very well for the chocolatier who is trying to add flavor to a chocolate coating. It will work with dark, milk or white chocolate coatings. For best distribution of flavor, it's recommended that a small amount of flavor oil for chocolate be added to a small amount of 76 degree coconut oil. A good starting usage for all of Nature's Flavors' flavor oils is approximately one quarter teaspoon of flavor per one pound of chocolate. If the flavor seems too strong, cut your usage in half. Typically, you should not be able to taste the flavor three to five seconds after you have swallowed the chocolate. It should have a clean feeling and should go away quickly, leaving you with the desire to have more. This is a difficult result to achieve since most connoisseurs, chefs and cooks having fun in their kitchen, tend to overdo it by adding more flavor than needed. In this case, the effect is that you won't want more even though you don't necessarily identify anything being wrong with the chocolate. Chocolate is a very intense flavor by itself so adding flavor to it and getting the right effect is difficult and takes practice. It is fun to experiment with the chocolate; achieving the perfect flavor profile can be very rewarding. Nature's Flavors' Flavor Oil for Chocolate is true to its name having a very sweet but delicate note. It bakes well in chocolate and also does very well in cookies, cakes and bread. It is very stable for weeks at room temperature and freezes well. All of the flavor oils work well in icings and oil based coatings. This flavor oil for chocolate can also be added to sauces and dressings and can be emulsified to become water soluble. Due to its very low usage level, there is little or no nutritional value. The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employee. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products.

A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again.

NF- 32116144,Vanilla Butter Nut Flavor Oil for Chocolate,"<p>Nature's Flavors Comliant Vanilla Butter Nut Flavor Oil for Chocolate is specially formulated for use in oil soluble chocolate applications. This flavor works well when added to pure chocolate or cocoa bases. It will not separate as long as the application is in an oil soluble form. This flavor oil works very well for the chocolatier who is trying to add flavor to a chocolate coating. It will work with dark, milk or white chocolate coatings.<br /><br /> For best distribution of flavor, it's recommended that a small amount of flavor oil for chocolate be added to a small amount of 76 degree coconut oil. A good starting usage for all of Natures Flavours' flavor oils is approximately one quarter teaspoon of flavor per one pound of chocolate. If the flavor seems too strong, cut your usage in half. Typically, you should not be able to taste the flavor three to five seconds after you have swallowed the chocolate. It should have a clean feeling and should go away quickly, leaving you with the desire to have more. This is a difficult result to achieve since most connoisseurs, chefs and cooks having fun in their kitchen, tend to overdo it by adding more flavor than needed. In this case, the effect is that you won't want more even though you don't necessarily identify anything being wrong with the chocolate.<br /><br /> Chocolate is a very intense flavor by itself so adding flavor to it and getting the right effect is difficult and takes practice. It is fun to experiment with the chocolate; achieving the perfect flavor profile can be very rewarding. Natures Flavours' Flavor Oil for Chocolate is true to its name having a very sweet but delicate note. It bakes well in chocolate and also does very well in cookies, cakes and bread. It is very stable for weeks at room temperature and freezes well. All of the flavor oils work well in icings and oil based coatings. This compliant flavor oil for chocolate can also be added to sauces and dressings and can be emulsified to become water soluble.

NF-3930/NAT/C,Zabaglione Flavor Oil for Chocolate,"<p>Nature's Flavors' Zabaglione Flavor Oil for Chocolate is specially formulated for use in oil soluble chocolate applications. This flavor works well when added to pure chocolate or cocoa bases. It will not separate as long as the application is in an oil soluble form. This flavor oil works very well for the chocolatier who is trying to add flavor to a chocolate coating. It will work with dark, milk or white chocolate coatings. For best distribution of flavor, it's recommended that a small amount of flavor oil for chocolate be added to a small amount of 76 degree coconut oil. A good starting usage for all of Nature's Flavors' flavor oils is approximately one quarter teaspoon of flavor per one pound of chocolate. If the flavor seems too strong, cut your usage in half. Typically, you should not be able to taste the flavor three to five seconds after you have swallowed the chocolate. It should have a clean feeling and should go away quickly, leaving you with the desire to have more. This is a difficult result to achieve since most connoisseurs, chefs and cooks having fun in their kitchen, tend to overdo it by adding more flavor than needed. In this case, the effect is that you won't want more even though you don't necessarily identify anything being wrong with the chocolate. Chocolate is a very intense flavor by itself so adding flavor to it and getting the right effect is difficult and takes practice. It is fun to experiment with the chocolate; achieving the perfect flavor profile can be very rewarding. Nature's Flavors' Flavor Oil for Chocolate is true to its name having a very sweet but delicate note. It bakes well in chocolate and also does very well in cookies, cakes and bread. It is very stable for weeks at room temperature and freezes well. All of the flavor oils work well in icings and oil based coatings. This flavor oil for chocolate can also be added to sauces and dressings and can be emulsified to become water soluble. Due to its very low usage level, there is little or no nutritional value. The processes for making flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are rather than just natural. You start by using only certified ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% Organic. When calling it 100% you must use only certified ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of and natural flavors are filtered RO water and alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients thru these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employee. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based flavor concentrate. To make the flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our products. We hope they bring you much enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>",01/06/2022,,99.19,,Default,Zabaglione Flavor Oil for Chocolate,Flavor the way nature intended.

Our Green Color (Lime) is the natural alternative to artificial dyes, and is packed full of powerful anti-oxidants and has anti-inflammatory properties. This natural green coloring is also heat and freeze stable. This is an all-natural proprietary blend of vegetable and fruit dyes, brought together with care to produce a beautiful green hue.<br /><br /> Why We Don't Use/Sell Chlorophyll:<br /> There are two reasons. First, although chlorophyll is the only pure, natural green color ingredient, the FDA has not yet approved its use as a color additive. Second, even if the FDA gave the go-ahead to sell it, it would not be an effective natural color to use because the color molecules are very fragile and break down extremely easily and quickly. Our natural green color is an effective and all-natural replacement. Replacement of Blue#1+ Yellow #6<br /><br /> Ingredients:<br /> Vegetable and Plant Extract (no Chlorophyll)<br /><br /> NOTE: Nature's Flavors makes no claims about the suitability of natural colors for any given purpose.

ST-9186,Naturlax® Berry Psyllium Fiber,"<p>Number 1: Psyllium adds additional bulk. Number 2: Psyllium makes it easier to, well&hellip; Number 2. Fiber is also known as &ldquo;natures broom&rdquo; because fiber sweeps through your intestines, scrubbing and sweeping as it moves, getting rid of harmful toxins and plaque. Your intestine is a whopping 28 feet long. To help you put that into perspective, that&rsquo;s the height of a typical two-story house. That means there&rsquo;s a lot of places where grit, grease, and bad bacteria can hide. Including additional fiber from Naturlax&reg; means you are well on your way to good health and reduce the risk of heart disease. 
<br /><br />
Every once in awhile, something comes along that gives us another chance. Naturlax&reg; psyllium is a second chance at health because it simply is never too late to have a brand new beginning. Not only does psyllium help to fight, but it also helps you maintain weight. Using plant-based ingredients as our flavors, Naturlax&reg; additionally helps to lower blood pressure and is ideal for heart health. And what&rsquo;s not to like about that? More to like about Naturlax&reg;&hellip; our flavors. Try Pineapple Flavored Naturlax&reg;, Mango Flavored Naturlax&reg;, and Japanese Plum Flavored Naturlax&reg;, too.

With attributes that help to reduce the risk of heart disease, Naturlax&reg; is a great supplement to add to your normal routine.

Additionally, Naturlax&reg; is a way to maintain a healthy weight. Psyllium swells and makes your belly feel full. Taken thirty minutes before a meal, Naturlax&reg; acts as a bulking agent to trick your stomach into having more contents than it actually does, so overeating is avoided. Additionally taking Naturlax post-meal will help move intestinal contents through at a slower pace, allowing your body to fully benefit from the nourishment of healthy meals. While Blueberry is delicious, we suggest trying Kiwi-Strawberry Flavored Naturlax&reg;, Grape Flavored Naturlax&reg;, and Fruit Punch Flavored Naturlax&reg; as well!

Not only does Brown Sugar Flavored Naturlax&reg; taste amazing, but it&rsquo;s so good for you, too. Naturlax&reg; psyllium powder is a healthy way to do a whole world of good for your body. Taken once, twice, or even three times a day, psyllium has been proven to be a catalyst in reducing cholesterol, lowering blood sugar, and maintaining a healthy weight. 
<br /><br />
You may be wondering&hellip; how will fiber help me with my weight? Taking Naturlax&reg; psyllium thirty minutes before mealtime creates a feeling of satiety, making you feel full. Psyllium starts off from the package in powder form, but when it is mixed with liquid and consumed, the powder turns into a gel-like consistency. The gel binds with existing stomach contents and, in turn, takes up more room within the stomach. Taking Naturlax&reg; after a meal is also ideal because it helps to move contents through the intestinal tract and out of the body. Not sure what you favorite flavor of Naturlax&reg; is just yet? Try Pumpkin Flavored Naturlax&reg;, Chocolate Fudge Flavored Naturlax&reg;, and Chai Flavored Naturlax&reg; as well. &nbsp;&nbsp;

Taking Naturlax&reg; is a known factor in helping to lower LDL, which is the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; cholesterol within the human body. Interestingly, many people simply don&rsquo;t eat enough fiber to begin with.

Incorporating Naturlax&reg; into your diet helps you in obtaining that goal. Consuming a diet rich in fiber helps to not only promote a healthy digestive system, but also helps to reduce the risk of life-threatening diseases like heart disease.

ST-9730,Naturlax® Irish Cream Psyllium Fiber,"<p>Fiber is an important part of everyone&rsquo;s diet, though we might not always think about it. Sure, we know that vegetables and fruits are healthy for us, but we don&rsquo;t always understand exactly why. The vitamins and nutrients found in produce do great things for our bodies, but so does the fiber. Fiber aids in digestion and regular bodily function. When taken 30 minutes prior to mealtime, Naturlax&reg; helps you to feel more full for a longer period of time. Psyllium fiber expands in your stomach leaving less room for foods that may be unhealthy. 
<br /><br />
Additionally, psyllium fiber helps to support a healthy blood level and supports healthy weight management. Regular usage of Naturlax&reg; helps to reduce free-radical damage throughout the body. Not only does Naturlax&reg; do a world of good when it comes to health, but it also tastes pretty amazing, too. If you like Irish Cream like we think you do, be sure to try Butterscotch Flavored Naturlax&reg;, Caramel Cream Flavored Naturlax&reg;, and Almond Cream Flavored Naturlax&reg; as well. Who would have guessed that health tasted so good?
<br /><br />

ST-9697,Naturlax® Japanese Plum Psyllium Fiber,"<p>There&rsquo;s no need to be glum when you have a bottle of Naturlax&reg; on your countertop. Taken once, twice, or even three times daily, it will help you on multiple levels. Just one tablespoon mixed with 8 ounces of your favorite beverage will have you well on your way to health in no time. Naturlax&reg; psyllium fiber helps to gently clean out your intestinal tract, ridding it of cholesterol and other toxins that have built up over the course of time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br /><br />
Want to know what else Naturlax&reg; can do for a healthy body? It helps to support healthy weight management. While you may find solace in knowing Naturlax&reg; psyllium fiber can help alleviate the occasional constipation and help to reduce free-radical damage, taking it before mealtime helps to simply reach the feeling of satiety. Since psyllium swells and becomes gelatinous as it mixes with the natural fluids in your gut, Naturlax&reg; helps you feel full and, thus, prevents you from reaching for less healthy foods. Naturlax&reg; also comes in Plum Flavored Naturlax&reg;, Strawberry Flavored Naturlax&reg;, and Apricot Flavored Naturlax&reg;, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;

Did we mention that Naturlax&reg; comes in over 80 delicious flavors? Well, it does. We know how to make supplements enjoyable and tasty because we like to see people happy&hellip; happy in life, happy in health, happy in peace of mind.

ST-9279,Naturlax® Lemon Lime Psyllium Fiber,"<p>Regular use of Naturlax&reg; can result in many positive impacts on your health including a lower risk of issues like heart disease. Additionally, psyllium fiber helps to lower your cholesterol and promote an overall healthy digestive health. In a day where toxins and impurities are lurking everywhere, now is the time to pay close attention to what your body is telling you. &nbsp;&nbsp;
<br /><br />
Psyllium fiber is special in that it starts off in powder form, but when added to your favorite beverage, it swells up to ten times its original size. As it moves through your intestinal tract, it continues to soak up more liquid, resulting in firmer stools. As Naturlax&reg; travels through your gut, it picks up particles that simply shouldn&rsquo;t be in there. Since psyllium is a very &ldquo;thirsty&rdquo; supplement, it&rsquo;s important to drink plenty of water throughout your day. And if you love Lemon Lime Flavored Naturlax&reg; as much as we do, then you&rsquo;ll want to try Citron Flavored Naturlax&reg;, Orange Flavored Naturlax&reg;, and Orange Mango Passion Flavored Naturlax&reg;, too. &iexcl;Que delicioso!

ST-9762,Naturlax® Lemonade Psyllium Fiber,"<p>We&rsquo;ve mentioned our flavors (there are over 80 to choose from), but we need to talk health stats, too. Naturlax&reg; is not only known for it&rsquo;s great taste, but also for its many health benefits. Using plant-based ingredients for our colors and flavors, we take the purity of our product very seriously. Naturlax&reg; chooses to forgo the use of harmful chemicals and colors like Yellow 6, also known as Sunset Yellow, which has been linked to gastric upset, hyperactivity, and headaches. Yellow 6 is currently banned in Norway and Finland and other countries are headed in that very same direction. But, if you like Lemonade Flavored Naturlax&reg; as much as we do, be sure to try Orange Flavored Naturlax&reg;, Lemon Lime Flavored Naturlax&reg;, and Tangerine Flavored Naturlax&reg;, too!

As the saying goes, &lsquo;garbage in, garbage out.&rsquo; You simply can&rsquo;t expect to see a positive change if you don&rsquo;t make any change. Not only is Naturlax&reg; the pure and clean approach to a healthy gut, but consuming a diet high in fiber can help to reduce inflammation. With so many factors involved in the health of the human body, it&rsquo;s so important to be mindful of what goes into your body (and even more about what doesn&rsquo;t). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

ST-9765,Naturlax® Macadamia Nut Psyllium Fiber,"<p>Have you ever thought of fiber as exciting? Yeah, you probably haven&rsquo;t. But Macadamia Nut Flavored Naturlax&reg; and the massive amount of health benefits might change your mind. Promoting a healthy heart, keeping blood sugar levels at bay, and relieving occasional irregularity - that&rsquo;s a pretty impressive list if we do say so ourselves. Need we say more? Well, we can because we&rsquo;re nuts about Naturlax&reg;. 
<br /><br />
Psyllium battles against disease, and it also helps you in the weight management department. It goes into your body and hones in on cholesterol and sugars that are about to soak in, and gets them out before it&rsquo;s too late and the damage has been done. Adding psyllium to your daily diet builds the walls of your colon and keeps you feeling fuller for longer, too. Talk about satisfied - there&rsquo;s no reason not to grab yourself a bottle of Macadamia Nut Flavored Naturlax&reg; right now. Even better, pick up Hazelnut Flavored Naturlax&reg; and Chocolate Fudge Flavored Naturlax&reg; right along with it.

ST-9712,Naturlax® Mandarin Orange Psyllium Fiber,"<p>It&rsquo;s simple to prepare Naturlax&reg;. Simply add one tablespoon of Naturlax&reg; psyllium fiber to your favorite beverage. You can mix Naturlax&reg; with anything from natural spring water, to coconut water, to almond milk, or even your favorite cold-pressed juice. Regular use of Naturlax&reg; helps to battle the bulge and maintain a healthy weight. And speaking of weight,we can&rsquo;t wait for you to try our other citrusy flavors. We not only have Mandarin Orange Flavored Naturlax&reg;, but we also have Citron Flavored Naturlax&reg;, Orange Mango Passion Flavored Naturlax&reg;, and Tangerine Flavored Naturlax&reg;. 
<br /><br />
A natural way to regulate bodily functions, Naturlax&reg; is a gluten-free, sugar-free, and worry-free way to do something great for your body. Psyllium also help to clean out your intestines, As psyllium swells when it comes in contact with the fluids in your intestinal tract, it scrubs the lining of the colon, ridding it of toxins and debris that build up over time, Because the intestines squeeze and compress as the psyllium moves through your body, it gives your insides a good workout, thus resulting in stronger intestines and a stronger immune system. &nbsp;&nbsp;
<br /><br />
Adults 12 years & older:
Put one rounded tablespoon into an empty glass. Mix this product with at least 8 ounces of liquid. Taking Naturlax&reg; Fiber without enough liquid may cause choking. See choking warning. Stir quickly and drink promptly. If mixture gets too thick add more liquid and stir briskly. Fiber can be taken two to three times daily.

ST-8670,Naturlax® Mango Psyllium Fiber,"<p>While we can agree that it takes two to mango, we can also agree that having a well balanced diet of fruits and vegetables along with leading an active lifestyle can sway you from the path of dangerous inflammation throughout the body. Commonly thought to be a supplement that promotes good digestive health and to relieve occasional constipation, psyllium is a bulking fiber that does more than you would expect. Knowing that your intestines span about 28 feet long leaves a lot of places for bad bacteria and toxins to hide, so when taken on a regular basis, psyllium helps to scrub out the impurities. &nbsp;
<br /><br />
With flavors that span the gamut of rich and creamy Chocolate Fudge Flavored Naturlax&reg; to wild and exotic Dragon Fruit Flavored Naturlax&reg;, we have every flavor for every taste and every occasion. Knowing the effects of what artificial ingredients can do, it&rsquo;s no wonder that we choose to only use real, plant-based ingredients in each of our flavors. Well, don&rsquo;t just sit there, man, go get some!

ST-9720,Naturlax® Papaya Psyllium Fiber,"<p>Other things you&rsquo;ll want to say? Heart health. Weight management. And normal blood sugar levels. Not only is Naturlax&reg; a great way to start your day, but you can also look forward to having it in the afternoon and again in the evening. One serving of Naturlax&reg; contains 6 grams of soluble fiber. That means if you take it three times in a day, you will have consumed a whopping 18 beautiful grams of fiber. Fiber is special because it acts as a natural way to clean out your insides. The common Western diet unfortunately has evolved to consist of a lot of processed ingredients such as refined sugar and white flour, which does nothing but slide through the colon. Regular use of psyllium fiber helps to clean the lining of the colon, one delicious sip at a time. 
<br /><br />
Speaking of delicious, we can't wait for you to try our flavors. If you like fruity flavors, we&rsquo;ve got Watermelon Flavors Naturlax&reg;. If you like chocolatey flavors, we have Chocolate Fudge Flavored Naturlax&reg;. And if you like indulgent, rich flavors, we have Cappuccino Flavored Naturlax&reg;. You name it, we have it.

ST-9776,Naturlax® Passion Fruit Psyllium Fiber,"<p>Another thing we&rsquo;re passionate about? Using pure, clean ingredients. While other companies allow artificial ingredients like aspartame and Yellow 6 to enter their products, Naturlax&reg; only uses real colors and flavors in our products, so there&rsquo;s never anything to worry about. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. What you see is what you get.

Additionally, Naturlax&reg; psyllium fiber works as a cleaning agent, scouring your colon from top to bottom. When psyllium enters the body, it swells and bulks, scrubbing the insides of the intestines, freeing debris or toxins that may have built up over time. Psyllium fiber is much more than just a supplement to alleviate occasional constipation, as it does so much more. Make Naturlax&reg; a regular part of your diet and you&rsquo;ll feel the difference that good health can make. &nbsp;

With benefits like that, why aren&rsquo;t y&rsquo;all taking Naturlax&reg; already?

Taken on a regular basis, Naturlax&reg; strengthens the intestines as well as the heart. Your intestinal tract kneads and squeezes waste as it moves through your body, giving your system a good workout. Modern Western diets weigh heavy in carbohydrates and processed foods which don&rsquo;t take much effort to be digested. Not only that, but nutrients in a common Western diet are at a bare minimum. Leading an active lifestyle and eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and fiber is the first part of implementing a healthy regime. Incorporating Naturlax&reg; is the next.

Getting enough fiber is a great way to help promote heart health and support digestive health. Fiber acts as a bulking agent which helps direct waste through the colon. We tend to frequently think about what&rsquo;s going on outside our body rather than what&rsquo;s going on inside, until sometimes it&rsquo;s too late. There&rsquo;s soaps, lotions, and sprays for skin, but what about for the heart and gut? Naturlax&reg; is a great place to start. One little product can make a very big change.

ST-9770,Naturlax® Sour Apple Psyllium Fiber,"<p>Fiber is important in all of our lives. It&rsquo;s a topic that&rsquo;s not thought of often, not discussed often, but should be. Your body is comprised of many different systems that all work closely together. There&rsquo;s nothing better than when they all work harmoniously together, but, if they don&rsquo;t, you better believe there will be a chain reaction. Imbalances, inflammation, and other complications are all connected. That means, if something happens to your intestine (or stomach or heart), one or more additional organs can be affected.
<br /><br />
Thankfully, fiber can help keep the body in line. Psyllium fiber can help keep your body in good, working order and promote good heart health. Not only that, but the regular use of Naturlax&reg; can help strengthen intestines, strengthen the heart, and help with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. Psyllium, a true superfood, helps make a great day, everyday. Can&rsquo;t decide which apple flavor is your favorite? Try Apple Flavored Naturlax&reg;, Apple Cider Flavored Naturlax&reg;, and Spiced Apple Flavored Naturlax&reg; to decide for yourself. &nbsp;&nbsp;

ST-9740,Naturlax® Spiced Apple Psyllium Fiber,"<p>Naturlax&reg; psyllium is a bulking fiber that helps in the prevention of stroke, chronic heart disease, and stroke when taken on a regular basis and comes in so many flavors, the choices are virtually endless. With fall flavors like Spiced Apple Flavored Naturlax&reg; to summer tastes like Orange Mango Passion Naturlax&reg;, we have a flavor to suit any mood. Mix any flavor with water, juice, almond milk, or anything else you can dream up. For a creamier concoction, try coconut milk. For a frosty concoction, try blending it with ice and fruit. No matter how you decide to stir, blend, or shake your Naturlax&reg;, it&rsquo;s a great way to get your extra dose of fiber. 
<br /><br />
Did we mention that Naturlax&reg; is naturally gluten-free? Not only that, but psyllium husk powder can also be used for gluten-free baking. That&rsquo;s right, gluten-free friends, many of your favorite baking recipes can be rewritten to utilize Naturlax&reg; instead of flour. Once psyllium comes into contact with moisture of any kind, a natural gelling effect is created. When used with ingredients such as eggs or oil, the gelling effect creates a similar consistency as gluten in flour. Look out world&hellip; a new gluten free star is born! And if you like Spiced Apple Flavored Naturlax&reg; as much as we do, make sure to try Apple Flavored Naturlax&reg;, Sour Apple Flavored Naturlax&reg;, and Apple Cider Flavored Naturlax&reg;.

ST-9781/NAT,Naturlax® Strawberry Kiwi Psyllium Fiber,"<p>Naturlax&reg; psyllium powder is a true superfood because it boasts healthful benefits. Not only does taking psyllium help to regulate high cholesterol, decrease blood sugar levels, and lower triglycerides, but it is also an active key player in helping to reduce the risk of heart disease, too. Many people skip actively trying to feed their body right and move directly to using drugs like statins to reduce cardiovascular disease. Naturlax&reg; psyllium powder goes right to the source to provide more fiber to the body.
<br /><br />
Continuing to make steps in the right direction is key. While it&rsquo;s hard to make so many changes at once--no matter how healthful--sometimes it&rsquo;s easier to make one small change at a time. Starting to exercise, eating better, and drinking Naturlax&reg; are all things that will help point your body in the right direction. Much more than just a regulator, Naturlax&reg; in a great step toward overall health and wellness. Looking for more great taste? Give Black Currant Flavored Naturlax&reg;, Berry Flavored Naturlax&reg;, and Apricot Flavored Naturlax&reg; a chance too.

ST-9676,Naturlax® Tangerine Psyllium Fiber,"<p>You&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;ve stuck a straw directly into a fresh tangerine when you try Tangerine Flavored Naturlax&reg;. All of the flavors and colors of the Naturlax&reg; product line are derived from natural plant-based matter. That means we use real produce like red radishes, spirulina, and beets to create our colors. We see no need in using fake food colors like Yellow 6 when we can make healthy and safe colorings on our own. Blueberry Flavored Naturlax&reg;, Kiwi Flavored Naturlax&reg;, and Cherry Flavored Naturlax&reg; give you a great scope of just what what natural ingredients can do. 
<br /><br />
Speaking of what Naturlax&reg; can do, regular use of psyllium can promote heart health by lowering cholesterol within the body. Also, great news for those with irritable bowel syndrome: psyllium helps to lessen its symptoms. And just when you thought things couldn&rsquo;t get any better, Naturlax&reg; can aid in weightloss, too. Taken 30 minutes prior to mealtime, it encourages the feeling of satiety, making you feel full. And, if taken after your meal, Naturlax&reg; will act as a bulking agent to help push waste through. No matter how you slice it, Tangerine Flavored Naturlax&reg; is all you need in a fiber supplement.

ST-9711,Naturlax® Yuzu Psyllium Fiber,"<p>It&rsquo;s getting harder and harder for some to get enough fiber nowadays. With the temptation of cakes and breads and other processed products, things like fruits and vegetables are simply appearing less appealing. In turn, disease has been on the rise due to this chain reaction. Toxins and inflammation in the body are now simply byproducts of poor diet. Naturlax&reg; psyllium powder can help with that. 
<br /><br />
Introducing additional fiber into an unhealthy diet can be beneficial in so many ways. Taken on a regular basis along with a healthy diet, Naturlax&reg; can help lower cholesterol, lower blood sugar, and strengthen your heart. This, of course, only names a few of this product&rsquo;s capabilities. A true superfood, psyllium helps to fight the risk of Type 2 Diabetes and also contributes to weight loss and weight maintenance. Not sure of your favorite Naturlax&reg; flavor just yet? Be sure to try Kiwi Flavored Naturlax&reg;, Watermelon Flavored Naturlax&reg;, and Apricot Flavored Naturlax&reg;, too!

NF-9804,Brandy Flavored Cotton Candy (Ready to Eat),"<p>What's brandy? Brandy is traditionally made from fermented fruit juice and it is also a natural derivative of wine. While it's classily served in a brandy snifter glass, we think it' far more fun to spin it into cotton candy. And, if you're wondering, there is no alcohol in this product. There's so many great ways to enjoy this flavor. While you can definitely enjoy it straight from the container, itself, you can also make some incredible cocktails with it by adding it into a martini glass and pouring a cocktail over it. Or you might also consider adding a piece of Brandy Cotton Candy on top of a sweet dessert to add interest, add height, and also add amazing flavor at the same time.</p>
