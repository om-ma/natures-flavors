NF-8416/ORG,"Allspice Berry Flavor Extract, Organic","<p>What's an allspice berry? An allspice berry is the berry that comes directly from the allspice plant. When dried, it darkens in color and resembles the overall appearance of a peppercorn. The term 'allspice' was actually given to this spice because it was thought to have smelled like literally all the spices. With accents of cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg, allspice berries are extremely important in Caribbean cuisine.
