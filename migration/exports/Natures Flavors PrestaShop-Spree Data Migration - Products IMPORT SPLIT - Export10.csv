NF-8416NT,"Allspice Berry Flavor Extract, Organic","<p>The processes for making organic flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are organic rather than just natural. You start by using only certified organic ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% organic. When calling it 100% organic you must use only certified organic ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified organic flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% organic flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own organic ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of organic and natural flavors are filtered RO water and organic alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients through these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employee. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take organic vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an organic alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard organic vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its organic vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the organic flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based organic flavor concentrate. To make the organic flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an organic gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and Gums to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest organic flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these organic products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our organic products. We hope they bring you much enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>",,01/01/2022,23.81,,Default,,Organic Allspice Berry Flavor Extract made from the finest organic plant based ingredients.

NF-1480/CFO/ND,Marshmallow Coffee and Tea Flavoring Without Diacetyl,"<p>Nature's Flavors Organic Marshmallow Coffee & Tea Flavoring System is a unique recipe specially tailored to penetrate coffee beans, tea leaves, and any other dried herbs. This Organic Flavoring System can also be used to flavor any type of water soluble liquid. All of our Certified Organic Coffee and Tea Flavors are all natural, Kosher, Vegan, Gluten Free, and contain NO Allergens! Nature's Flavors Organic Coffee & Tea Flavoring Systems are water soluble, in addition they will mix into Glycerin, and Propylene Glycol solutions even better than our Organic Flavor Extracts. To add Marshmallow Flavor to your own Coffee Beans, Tea Leaves, and other dried Herbs, simply take one pound of roasted coffee beans and one-half of a teaspoon of your favorite Nature's Flavors Organic Flavoring System for Coffee and Tea and sprinkle it over your beans. For the most even distribution we use a sprayer, instead of sprinkling. Once you have distributed your Flavor over your Coffee, we recommend that you place these newly flavored beans within a seal-able container like a mason jar, old coffee can, or a zip lock back, then shake it up to help spread the flavor out, and then let the sealed container sit for 24 hours to allow the flavors to permeate the coffee or tea. Nature's Flavors has recently renamed our Organic Flavor Oils for Coffee and Tea (Organic Coffee and Tea Flavoring Oils) to Organic Flavoring Systems for Coffee and Tea (Organic Coffee and Tea Flavoring Systems) due to the fact that the name Flavor Oil was misleading. Nature's Flavors Coffee and Tea Flavoring Systems are not set in an oil base, and are not oil soluble. They are a direct evolution from our Flavor Extracts. Like our Flavor Extracts they are set in an alcohol base, in addition, these Organic Flavoring Systems also include a vegetable glycerin component to help the flavors permeate the coffee beans and/or tea leaves. It will evaporate out of the beans or herbs usually with in the first 24 hours you will smell a little alcohol when you first open the sealed container, any remaining alcohol will burn off immediately when you brew the coffee or tea. These flavors have no nutritional value as used in this application are calorie, carb, and sugar free. There is no fat. Enjoy. Ingredients: Organic Flavors, Vegetable Glycerin, and Organic Ethyl Alcohol. The processes for making organic flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are organic rather than just natural. You start by using only certified organic ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% organic. When calling it 100% organic you must use only certified organic ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified organic flavors. It is our goal to produce only 100% organic flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own organic ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of organic and natural flavors are filtered RO water and organic alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients through these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employ. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take organic vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an organic alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard organic vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its organic vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the organic flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based organic flavor concentrate. To make the organic flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an organic gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gum's to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest organic flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these organic products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our organic products. We hope they bring you much enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>",01/06/2022,,1124.13,,Default,,Marshmallow Coffee and Tea Flavoring - Without Diacetyl  Natures Flavors  The finest organic and Natural ingredients.

Natures Flavours Stevia Powder is approximately three hundred times stronger than regular sugar! Natures Flavours offers many low carb products that we make with Stevia.<br /><br /> Although Stevia is a relatively new item in the United States, it has been a common sweetener in other parts of the world for decades. Stevia is attractive to diabetics and dieters because it has virtually no effect on blood glucose levels; there is even some research that says that it helps enhance glucose tolerance.<br /><br /> Natures Flavours is happy to offer Stevia Powder as a sugar substitute and no bitterness. Nature's Flavors' new Debitterized Stevia Sweetener Powder is replacing our NF-5195 Stevia Sweetener Powder.

This Organic Flavoring System can also be used to flavor any type of water soluble liquid. All of our Certified Organic Coffee and Tea Flavors withou Diacetyl are all natural, Kosher, Vegan, Gluten Free, and contain NO Allergens! Nature's Flavors Organic Coffee & Tea Flavoring without Diacetyl Systems are water soluble, in addition they will mix into Glycerin, and Propylene Glycol solutions even better than our Organic Flavor Extracts. <br /><br />To add Lemon Flavor to your own Coffee Beans, Tea Leaves, and other dried Herbs, simply take one pound of roasted coffee beans and one-half of a teaspoon of your favorite Nature's Flavors Organic Flavoring System for Coffee and Tea without Diacetyl and sprinkle it over your beans. For the most even distribution we use a sprayer, instead of sprinkling. Once you have distributed your Flavor over your Coffee, we recommend that you place these newly flavored beans within a seal-able container like a mason jar, old coffee can, or a zip lock bag, then shake it up to help spread the flavor out, and then let the sealed container sit for 24 hours to allow the flavors to permeate the coffee or tea. <br /><br />Nature's Flavors has recently renamed our Organic Flavor Oils for Coffee and Tea (Organic Coffee and Tea Flavoring Oils) to Organic Flavoring Systems for Coffee and Tea (Organic Coffee and Tea Flavoring Systems including without Diacetyl) due to the fact that the name Flavor Oil was misleading. Nature's Flavors Coffee and Tea Flavoring Systems are not set in an oil base, and are not oil soluble. They are a direct evolution from our Flavor Extracts. Like our Flavor Extracts they are set in an alcohol base, in addition, these Organic Flavoring Systems also include a vegetable glycerin component to help the flavors permeate the coffee beans and/or tea leaves. <br /><br />It will evaporate out of the beans or herbs usually with in the first 24 hours you will smell a little alcohol when you first open the sealed container; any remaining alcohol will burn off immediately when you brew the coffee or tea. These flavors have no nutritional value as used in this application are calorie, carb, and sugar free. There is no fat. Enjoy. <br /><br />Ingredients: Organic Flavors, Vegetable Glycerin, and Organic Ethyl Alcohol. The processes for making organic flavors are much the same as for making natural flavors. The ingredients are organic rather than just natural. You start by using only certified organic ingredients when available and when not you may use naturals provided they fit with in the definition of natural and only comprise less than 5% of the total amount when calling it 95% organic. When calling it 100% organic you must use only certified organic ingredients and nothing else. Nature's Flavors carries both 95% and 100% certified organic flavors. <br /><br />It is our goal to produce only 100% organic flavor concentrates and extracts as the ingredients become available. In many instances we produce our own organic ingredients to satisfy our strict quality control requirements. Because the industry is still very young the technology's to make these ingredients are still evolving. The only solvents that we use in the development of organic and natural flavors are filtered RO water and organic alcohol. If we can't extract the ingredients through these methods then we don't do it. Steam distillation is another method we employee. Fortunately this is in most cases the only methods needed to manufacture these unique flavor concentrates and extracts. <br /><br />A simple and common process for making vanilla extract is to take organic vanilla beans and grind them to a pulp then allow them to soak and extract in an organic alcohol/water mixture for a period of time sometimes for up to several months. Normally for a standard organic vanilla extract you would extract for a period of not less than fourteen days. That's how long Nature's Flavors allows its organic vanilla extract to age and extract. This method is common for our citrus and other fruit flavor extracts as well. There are usually some filtering and clarifying techniques that follow the extraction process before being bottled or packaged. <br /><br />There are no chemical residues because there are no chemical solvents used. Many of the organic flavoring ingredients are derived this way first before being incorporated in to water based or oil based organic flavor concentrate. To make the organic flavor concentrates water soluble you must emulsify the oils that were derived and separated from the extraction process or steam distilling and that usually involves using an organic gum or starch and under high pressure and shearing. This process forces the oils and gum's to be broken into very small particles and cling to one another with out reforming into there basic building blocks again. The entire process is safe and effective for producing the finest organic flavor oils, flavor concentrates, and flavor extracts. Nature's Flavors has pioneered many of these methods for producing these organic products. We are proud of our flavorings, spices, coffees, and all our organic products.

<p>Nature&rsquo;s Flavors uses sunflower oil as one of our carrier oils, but many people use sunflower oil for many different purposes. Sunflower oil is a great oil for frying. Do you like French fries? How about tortilla chips? Nature's Flavors Sunflower Oil is a great light-tasting oil that does not dominate a product&rsquo;s flavor, but only accentuates it. It leaves your finished product light, crisp, and virtually perfect. The next time you&rsquo;re looking to create a flavor oil of your own, let a handful of fresh herbs like basil, rosemary, sage, and thyme sit in a container of sunflower oil for a period of time. Sure enough, after the herbs infuse into the sunflower oil for just 2-3 weeks, the earthy flavor of the herbs is imparted into Nature's Flavors Sunflower Oil. This process creates a great oil to cook with and will add a great flavor to anything that you decide to create. Be sure to try this process with Nature's Flavors Sunflower Oil and garlic cloves or chili flakes, too.&nbsp;</p>

The word &lsquo;raspberry&rsquo; comes from the Old French term &lsquo;raspise,&rsquo; a sweet rose-colored wine. The dark hue of blackberries ensures that they have one of the highest levels of antioxidants of all fruits. There&rsquo;s actually a museum in Belgium that is dedicated just to strawberries.

NF-10104/ORG/E,"Tropical Fruit Punch Emulsion for High Heat Applications, Organic","<p><div><strong>History &amp; Folklore</strong></div>
<p>The word &lsquo;punch&rsquo; actually is derived from the Sanskrit word meaning &lsquo;five,&rsquo; simply because the original version of this fruity beverage had five simple ingredients: alcohol, sugar, lemon, water, and tea or various spices. Though fruit punch recipes have evolved since that time, the sheer popularity of the drink has continued to rise. Always a popular drink, tropical fruit punch goes by many names throughout the world: punsch in Germany, sujeonggwa in Korea, and ponche in Mexico. Variations of fruit punch can either be free of any alcohol and safe for all ages, or can include versions for adults that contain ingredients like rum, wine, cider, mezcal, tequila, etc. The Caribbean and other tropical islands like Hawaii are well known for their fruit punch recipes as well. A Hawaiian tropical fruit punch fishbowl may be a festive way to enjoy this famously fruity drink--a large round fishbowl filled to the top with ice, perhaps a few small plastic tropical fish submerged, of course, fruit punch, and a handful of straws to share in the fun with friends.</p>

NF-9989/NAT/L,Pink Grapefruit Blend Flavor Oil for Lip Balm,"<p><div><strong>History &amp; Folklore</strong></div>
<p>The grapefruit, the original &lsquo;forbidden fruit,&rsquo; is a fun, fresh flavor that is used for so many tasty purposes. Commonly known as a chilled juice served at breakfast time, grapefruits contain a healthful juice and pulp that is slightly sour to slightly sweet, and even sometimes a tad bit bitter. Grapefruits are commonly served at the breakfast table cut in half pre-sectioned using a grapefruit spoon with brown sugar or honey on top and broiled until caramelized. Additionally, the grapefruit can be sectioned or supremed for use in green salads and fresh fruit salads. We enjoy the flavor of pink grapefruit because it can be introduced into fun applications, including tasty, lip-smacking lip balms and lipglosses.</p>

NF-10070/ORG,"Vanilla Flavor Concentrate - Alcohol Free, Organic","<p><div><strong>History &amp; Folklore</strong></div>
<p>Second in cost only to saffron, real vanilla can be a very costly ingredient. Simply because of the amount of care that is put into the planting, growing, raising, and processing of vanilla plants and beans. Once a vanilla plant matures and blooms, gorgeous orchids form. Each flower must be pollinated in order to create one vanilla bean. Once the vanilla bean is fully developed, they are harvested, cured, dried, and processed. The vanillin content in each vanilla bean determines the quality, flavor, and scent of the end product. Vanilla is the most common flavor throughout the world and is commonly found in vanilla ice cream, vanilla cake, vanilla frosting, vanilla-flavored cookies, and vanilla pudding. Since vanilla is such a common yet popular flavor, the sky's the limit as to what can be produced with this traditional flavor.</p>
<div><strong>Daily Uses</strong></div>
<p>Perfect for so many of your unique applications, our Organic Alcohol-Free Vanilla Concentrate is ideal for thicker products like smoothies, yogurts, frozen yogurts, ice cream, custards, and puddings as well as great for baked goods of all kinds. Croissants, bread, pound cakes, cookies, cakes, and pies can all benefit from the great and traditional flavor of vanilla. This product is high-heat stable, water-based, and unsweetened. Since our products are concentrated, Nature&rsquo;s Flavors suggests that only a small amount should be used when first experimenting with your flavors and then gradually increase the dosage until you reach an end product that you just can&rsquo;t resist!</p>

<div><strong>Recipes</strong></div>
<p>What&rsquo;s better than a scoop of homemade vanilla ice cream? Next time the weather is hot, how about making coffee ice cream. This recipe is great for kids of all ages. <br /><br />Start by mixing half and a half or milk, sugar, one egg (optional), and Nature&rsquo;s Flavors Organic Alcohol-Free Vanilla Concentrate in a small coffee can (1 pound). Close lid to smell coffee can tightly with duct tape and set inside a larger coffee can (3 pounds) and fill with ice and rock salt. Again, close this coffee can with duct tape as well. Have your kids (or adults) sit outside on the ground about 3 to 4 feet apart. Roll the coffee can back and forth for about 8 minutes. After rolling the can back and forth for 8 minutes, take the lid off to see if the ice cream has hardened. If it hasn&rsquo;t, add more ice and rock salt, seal up both containers, and roll for another 8 minutes. What results is an ultra-creamy, extra delicious, homemade vanilla ice cream made with our vanilla concentrate. For a different approach, try adding <a href=""https://www.naturesflavors.com/flavor-syrup-natural/64652-chocolate-flavor-syrup-kosher-vegan-gluten-free.html?search_query=chocolate+syrup&amp;results=20"">Nature&rsquo;s Flavors Chocolate Flavor Syrup</a>&nbsp;or macerated strawberries.</p>

NF-10083/NAT,"Habanero Flavor Oil, Natural","<p><div><strong>Daily Uses</strong></div>
<p>Nature&rsquo;s Flavors Habanero Flavor Oil can be used for so many tasty applications. Add it to olive oil to create a great flavored oil to use in cooking and dressings, add a few drops to a salsa that needs an extra burst of flavor, or come up with your own new and exciting concoction. One of our favorite ways to use Nature&rsquo;s Flavors Habanero Flavor Oil is to add it to melted chocolate to create a savory sweet treat that is shockingly good. No matter the application, the mighty habanero plant brings a big excitement from such a little pepper.</p>
<div><strong>Health Benefits</strong></div>
<p>Did you know that eating spicy foods helps to rev up your metabolism? Habanero benefits abound with this spicy pepper. Not only do spicy foods help with blood flow and circulation, but the reason why the human body sweats when it encounters spicy foods is because sweat acts as a natural air conditioner to cool the body down. Have you ever seen someone have a bowl of hot and spicy soup on a hot day? Doing so simply provides a natural way to cool down on even the hottest of days. And, speaking of natural, our natural products are made from real plant-based extracts. What's more, we don&rsquo;t even begin to make your products until you place your order. Doing this ensures that you receive the freshest products possible.</p>
<div><strong>Recipes</strong></div>
<p>Get ready to turn up the heat. We love flavors that are a little sweet and a little spicy. What better way to match the two together than to create habanero chocolate. Over a double boiler, melt any type of chocolate you&rsquo;d like over medium heat--for this recipe, we especially like using dark chocolate. Once the chocolate has been melted and no lumps remain, add in a few drops of Nature&rsquo;s Flavors Habanero Flavor Oil and stir together to combine. Remember that our flavors are concentrated, so begin by using only a little bit and add more to your personal preference. Keep in mind that it&rsquo;s easier to add than it is to take away. Carefully pour melted chocolate into candy molds or even small muffin tins and sprinkle the top with coarse sea salt. Set aside to cool and harden. When your chocolates have fully cooled, you&rsquo;ll have amazing dark chocolate with the bite of habanero flavor with a great hint of saltiness.</p>

NF-10099/ORG,"Rhubarb Flavor Powder, Organic","<p><div><strong>History &amp; Folklore</strong></div>
<p>What is rhubarb? Rhubarb is a seasonal stalk that, though is not technically a fruit itself, is treated as one in culinary preparations. Because of its naturally tart flavor, rhubarb is commonly cooked along with sugar or another sweetener in order to help make it more palpable. Common recipes that are created with rhubarb are rhubarb cake, rhubarb pie, rhubarb crumble, rhubarb custard, or even rhubarb sauce. Rhubarb is commonly incorporated into recipes with other fruits.

<p>What is rhubarb? Rhubarb is a seasonal stalk that, though is not technically a fruit itself, is treated like one in culinary preparations. Because of its naturally tart flavor, rhubarb is commonly cooked along with sugar or another sweetener in order to help make it more palpable. Common recipes that are created with rhubarb are rhubarb cake, rhubarb pie, rhubarb crumble, rhubarb custard, or even rhubarb sauce. Rhubarb is commonly incorporated into recipes with other fruits. Common combinations for desserts include strawberry rhubarb as well as apple rhubarb. Fun fact: Benjamin Franklin is noted for originally introducing rhubarb to America in 1770, as he sent a crate of it from London along to his friend, John Bartram, who was also responsible for introducing poinsettias and kohlrabi to America as well.</p>

NF-10468/NAT/S,Sante Lavender CO2 Extracted Essential Oil,"<p>Always in search of superior quality and optimal purity, Nature’s Flavors is continuously reaching toward more modern and efficient procedures for creating and collecting our essential oils. With today’s advances in both technology and chemistry, CO2 Extracted Essential Oils prove to be the best grade that can be reached. To craft our line of CO2 Extracted Essential Oils, we put the highest quality plant matter through a supercritical fluid extraction, which helps to remove the essential oils in a way that leaves no residues, maintains terpene levels, and prevents any damage from being done to the chemical structure and aroma of the oil. Since CO2 is virtually colorless, tasteless, and odorless, it’s the ideal solvent for capturing the highest quality essential oils. Compared to steam distillation, the CO2 extraction process is a faster, more efficient way of crafting oils. And, because lower temperatures are used during the CO2 extraction process, heat-sensitive plant components that might have otherwise been damaged through a normal steam distillation are otherwise preserved. What remains is a creamy, semi-solid product that can go into a wide variety of applications. Sante Lavender CO2 Extracted Essential Oil can be used for all your essential oil needs.

NF-10545/ORG,"Tea Tree Flavor Oil, Organic","<p>The tea tree, also referred to as Melaleuca alternifolia, is the source of one of the world&rsquo;s most popular products. With notes that are deep, earthy, and quite similar to that of eucalyptus, tea tree oil has been used for generations as a folk medicine which has been believed to alleviate symptoms of a variety of ailments. Nature&rsquo;s Flavors Organic Tea Tree Flavor Oil can be used in so many of your one-of-a-kind projects. Perfect for oil-based applications, our selection of organic flavor oils can be used in everything from chocolate, to candy, to lip balms, and more. Additionally, our flavor oils can add soothing fragrance to homemade candles and other similar products. Keep in mind, though, as you are working on a recipe or application, that our products are concentrated, so a little will go a long way. As a general rule of thumb, flavor oils should be used within the range of approximately .5% - 3% of your total ingredients. And, because each recipe is different from the next, there is simply no &lsquo;one-size-fits-all&rsquo; approach to flavoring. Experimentation will be eminent to get your ratios just right. To prevent from over-flavoring, begin by using a small amount of flavor oil in your project and, if that&rsquo;s not enough, slowly incorporate more until you reach a final product that is ideal for you and your personal taste. If you reach a flavor that lingers on your tongue for too long or a flavor that tastes medicinal, you&rsquo;ve added too much. It&rsquo;s very easy to overuse a flavor, so be vigilant during this process. Remember to take copious notes during your experimentation as these notes will provide a great resource when you need to look back to compare. Be sure to list the ingredients used, how much of each ingredient is incorporated, the temperature and length of time the product is cooked or baked for, etc.&nbsp;<br /><br />Blog Article:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=""https://blog.naturesflavors.com/tea-tree-oil-benefits/"">5 Benefits of Tea Tree Oil</a></p>",01/06/2022,,31.74,,Default,Tea Tree Flavor (Organic) Oil,Savor the flavor nature intended.
